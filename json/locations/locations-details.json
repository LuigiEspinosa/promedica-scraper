We serve patients from the 21-county geographic regions of northwest Ohio and southeast Michigan. Although we are a pediatric office, our Cystic Fibrosis Center provides care for pediatric and adult patients. We use a multi-disciplinary approach to meet all of your cystic fibrosis related care needs. Our care team consists of pediatric and adult physicians, nurse coordinators, social workers, dieticians, respiratory therapists and research coordinators. To provide you with the best patient outcomes, our CF Center participates in the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation Patient Registry. This Registry tracks patient outcomes, enabling informed decision making about quality improvement and standardized care for patients with CF.</p> \n\n\n<p>Our long-established program has also received Quality Improvement Awards from the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation for sustaining quality improvement work that has led to better health outcomes for people with cystic fibrosis. </p>\n\n\n<p>In 2006, a robust clinical research program was developed within our Cystic Fibrosis Care Center, in conjunction with the Cystic Fibrosis Therapeutics Development Network (TDN). The TDN was created by the CF Foundation and is one of the largest CF clinical networks in the world, bringing together experts from across the country to evaluate the safety and efficacy of new CF therapies. Our center is currently enrolling patients in research studies aimed at developing new gene-targeted therapies to correct the basic defect that causes cystic fibrosis. By working in collaboration with the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation and industry sponsors, we hope to one-day find a cure for CF.</p>\n<hr>\n<h4>Contact </h4>\n<p><strong>Lead Research Coordinator:</strong> Kelly Hoot, RN, BSN - <a href=\"mailto:Kelly.hoot@promedica.org\">Kelly.hoot@promedica.org</a><br> \n<strong>Adult Coordinator:</strong> Amanda Schreiner RN, BSN - <a href=\"mailto:Amanda.schreiner@promedica.org\">Amanda.schreiner@promedica.org</a><br> \n<strong>Pediatric Coordinator:</strong> Tyger Adoure-Zehaim RN, BSN - <a href=\"mailto:Tyger.Adoure-Zehaim@promedica.org \">Tyger.Adoure-Zehaim@promedica.org</a></p> \n</div>",

And that her daughter and son-in-law, Kaitlyn’s primary caregivers, would be able to take time for themselves while feeling that Kaitlyn was safely being cared for and enjoying her time with friends. This grandmother envisioned a warm, safe place that was full of laughter and encouragement for everyone.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>In 2012, the dream came to life and Kaitlyn’s Cottage opened its doors. Kaitlyn’s Cottage is a country cottage providing day, evening and overnight respite for people who live with intellectual and physical disabilities.</p> \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Services are provided in a warm, home environment that has a large accessible kitchen, great room with fireplace, library, activity rooms, accessible bathrooms and four private bedrooms.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Although located on the campus of <a href=\"/location/promedica-defiance-regional-hospital\">ProMedica Defiance Regional Hospital</a>, Kaitlyn’s Cottage is a non-medical respite care facility. If a participant has intensive medical needs, they will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis within the scope of our care.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Individuals of all ages needing respite care are welcome.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<h3>Services</h3>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Daytime, evening, weekend and overnight respite services can be scheduled on any given day or time to accommodate your family’s need. Daytime respite can range from just a few hours to an entire day. The number of participants that can be served is dependent on the special needs of each individual and the planned activities. Overnights can range from one night, a weekend, even an entire week or more. Up to four participants can stay each night.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<h3>Parent and Caregiver Resources</h3>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>For our families, we offer Cottage Connections meetings. Here, you will feel like part of a community comprised of those who are experiencing the joys and challenges that all caregivers of individuals with special needs face. You will be able to relax, enjoy conversations and share with other caregivers – mothers, fathers, grandparents, siblings – who “get it.” </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"divider-green\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<h2>Interested in Staying at Kaitlyn's Cottage</h2>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"/find-locations/forms/kaitlyns-cottage-interest\" class=\"btn btn-primary\">Fill out interest form </a></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<hr>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<h4>Application Process</h4>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>No one will be denied respite support based on inability to pay. With the generous donations from our community and the support of ProMedica Defiance Regional Hospital, we are able to offer respite services to our families on a sliding fee scale based on each family’s household size and income. If you have any questions about payment and billing, please don’t hesitate to contact us. We will be happy to discuss personalized payment options with you.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>If you are interested in volunteering or donating to Kaitlyn’s Cottage, please contact us at <a href=\"tel:1-419-783-4411\">419-783-4411</a>.

This grandmother envisioned a warm, safe place that was full of laughter and encouragement for everyone.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>In 2012, the dream came to life and Kaitlyn’s Cottage opened its doors. Kaitlyn’s Cottage is a country cottage providing day, evening and overnight respite for people who live with intellectual and physical disabilities.</p> \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Services are provided in a warm, home environment that has a large accessible kitchen, great room with fireplace, library, activity rooms, accessible bathrooms and four private bedrooms.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Although located on the campus of <a href=\"/location/promedica-defiance-regional-hospital\">ProMedica Defiance Regional Hospital</a>, Kaitlyn’s Cottage is a non-medical respite care facility. If a participant has intensive medical needs, they will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis within the scope of our care.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Individuals of all ages needing respite care are welcome.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<h3>Services</h3>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Daytime, evening, weekend and overnight respite services can be scheduled on any given day or time to accommodate your family’s need. Daytime respite can range from just a few hours to an entire day. The number of participants that can be served is dependent on the special needs of each individual and the planned activities. Overnights can range from one night, a weekend, even an entire week or more. Up to four participants can stay each night.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<h3>Parent and Caregiver Resources</h3>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>For our families, we offer Cottage Connections meetings. Here, you will feel like part of a community comprised of those who are experiencing the joys and challenges that all caregivers of individuals with special needs face. You will be able to relax, enjoy conversations and share with other caregivers – mothers, fathers, grandparents, siblings – who “get it.” </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"divider-green\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<h2>Interested in Staying at Kaitlyn's Cottage</h2>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"/find-locations/forms/kaitlyns-cottage-interest\" class=\"btn btn-primary\">Fill out interest form </a></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<hr>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<h4>Application Process</h4>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>No one will be denied respite support based on inability to pay. With the generous donations from our community and the support of ProMedica Defiance Regional Hospital, we are able to offer respite services to our families on a sliding fee scale based on each family’s household size and income. If you have any questions about payment and billing, please don’t hesitate to contact us. We will be happy to discuss personalized payment options with you.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>If you are interested in volunteering or donating to Kaitlyn’s Cottage, please contact us at <a href=\"tel:1-419-783-4411\">419-783-4411</a>. We invite you to use your skills, passions or resources to serve at Kaitlyn’s Cottage.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://tourmkr.com/F1o5qPulKU\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"btn btn-primary\">Take our virtual tour</a></p>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"row\">\n<div class=\"col-xs-12 col-sm-6\">\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/KaitlynsCottage/\" target=\"_blank\"><i class=\"fab fa-facebook-square fa-4x\"></i></a>\n</p></div>\n\n<div class=\"col-xs-12 col-sm-6\">\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/ProMedicaTV\" target=\"_blank\"><i class=\"fab fa-youtube fa-4x\"></i></a></p><p>\n</p></div></div>\n\n\n</div>",
