Our vision is to help them to heal and reclaim their lives.

Research shows that child trauma survivors can be more likely to have long-term health problems (e.g., diabetes and heart disease) or to die at an earlier age. Traumatic stress can also lead to increased use of health and mental health services and increased involvement with the child welfare and\njuvenile justice systems. Adult survivors of traumatic events may also have difficulty in establishing fulfilling relationships and maintaining employment.</p>\n\n\n<p>The mission of The Cullen Center is to recognize the family as an expert and develop mutually respectful and equal partnerships among trauma survivors, families and professionals. Part of our job as experts is to find the best possible tools available to help families reclaim their lives. We accomplish through evidence-based and best practice trauma-focused counseling and education. A therapy model is considered evidence-based when it has been tested and proven to improve children’s performance and reduce children’s trauma-related symptoms.</p>\n\n\n<p>Following are therapies we currently provide are:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Trauma-focused Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (TF-CBT)</li>\n\n\t<li>Child Parent Psychotherapy (CPP)</li>\n\n\t<li>Attachment, Regulation Competency therapy (ARC)</li>\n\n\t<li>Theraplay and Theraplay techniques</li>\n\n\t<li>STRONG Families therapy</li>\n\n\t<li>Cognitive Processing Therapy (CPT)</li>\n\n\t<li>Trauma-informed Parenting (TIP)</li>\n\n\t<li>Hip Hop HEALS (H3\n)</li>\n\n\t<li>Individual and family counseling</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>In addition, trauma-informed individual and family interventions such as:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Support</li>\n\n\t<li>Child and family education</li>\n\n\t<li>Crisis intervention</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Other services we provide for the community include:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Trauma-informed consultation</li>\n\n\t<li>Community education</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h4>ACCESSING OUR SERVICES</h4>\n\n<p>Our goal is to determine if our services will best meet your child’s needs.
