We serve patients from the 21-county geographic regions of northwest Ohio and southeast Michigan. Although we are a pediatric office, our Cystic Fibrosis Center provides care for pediatric and adult patients. We use a multi-disciplinary approach to meet all of your cystic fibrosis related care needs. Our care team consists of pediatric and adult physicians, nurse coordinators, social workers, dieticians, respiratory therapists and research coordinators. To provide you with the best patient outcomes, our CF Center participates in the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation Patient Registry. This Registry tracks patient outcomes, enabling informed decision making about quality improvement and standardized care for patients with CF. <br />Our long-established program has also received Quality Improvement Awards from the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation for sustaining quality improvement work that has led to better health outcomes for people with cystic fibrosis. <br />In 2006, a robust clinical research program was developed within our Cystic Fibrosis Care Center, in conjunction with the Cystic Fibrosis Therapeutics Development Network (TDN). The TDN was created by the CF Foundation and is one of the largest CF clinical networks in the world, bringing together experts from across the country to evaluate the safety and efficacy of new CF therapies. Our center is currently enrolling patients in research studies aimed at developing new gene-targeted therapies to correct the basic defect that causes cystic fibrosis. By working in collaboration with the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation and industry sponsors, we hope to one-day find a cure for CF.<br />Contact <br />Lead Research Coordinator: Kelly Hoot, RN, BSN - <a href='mailto:Kelly.hoot@promedica.org'>Kelly.hoot@promedica.org</a><br /> <br />Adult Coordinator: Amanda Schreiner RN, BSN - <a href='mailto:Amanda.schreiner@promedica.org'>Amanda.schreiner@promedica.org</a><br /> <br />Pediatric Coordinator: Tyger Adoure-Zehaim RN, BSN - <a href='mailto:Tyger.Adoure-Zehaim@promedica.org '>Tyger.Adoure-Zehaim@promedica.org</a> <br />",

The EksoNR™ helps stroke and spinal cord injury patients gain mobility quicker, and gain more confidence and independence as well. The device uses support mechanisms and real-time adjustments so that patients are supported as they re-learn correct step patterns, weight shifting and posture.  <br /><a href='/services-and-conditions/robotic-exoskeleton-therapy-and-rehab'>Learn More</a><br />Frequently Asked Questions<br /><a href='#collapse1'>What sets Eidi Family Rehabilitation Center apart from other programs?</a><br />Eidi Family Rehabilitation Center features spacious private and semi-private rooms with ample space for relaxing and family visiting. In addition, we have a 3-room transition apartment where patients can test their readiness for independent living. The goal of the transition apartment is to give patients the opportunity to practice tasks and become confident in their abilities prior to discharge.<br /><a href='#collapse2'>Do you have specific admission guidelines?</a><br />We use pre-admission criteria established by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. This ensures that the patients entering the program will benefit from participation. Our personnel work closely with families, discharge planners, and other medical and rehabilitation professionals to gather information and plan treatment programs for the earliest discharge possible.<br /><a href='#collapse3'>Does your staff have experience treating patients with specific diagnoses?</a><br />Our team of experts have received extensive training in rehabilitation interventions for patients after stroke, brain injury, spinal cord injury, multiple traumas, complicated orthopaedic conditions, hip fracture, amputation, burn, pain, or other illness. Our team of physicians, nurses and therapists have hundreds of years of combined clinical experience in rehabilitation with proven results. Over 80% of our patients return home upon discharge.<br /><a href='#collapse4'>How much therapy is provided?</a><br />Therapy involves many components beyond the traditional physical therapy, occupational therapy and speech-language pathology available in many hospitals. Rehabilitation nursing, case management and therapeutic recreation also work as members of our interdisciplinary team to provide a comprehensive rehabilitation program for inpatients. Therapies are scheduled daily, with the goal of patients working toward being able to tolerate three hours of therapy a day or 900 minutes per week.<br /><a href='#collapse5'>Who makes up the medical staff at Eidi Family Rehabilitation Center?</a><br />Our medical directors are board-certified physical medicine and rehabilitation physicians. In addition to physical medicine and rehabilitation physicians, internal medicine physicians are also available to care for patients’ medical needs while they are in our care. Since we are located on the Flower Hospital campus, patients have convenient access to emergency and consultative services. You can have peace of mind knowing you will have prompt attention to your medical needs.<br /><a href='#collapse7'>What’s the family’s role in rehabilitation?</a><br />Family members and friends are considered a special part of the treatment process. Staff members work closely with families during education sessions to provide hands-on learning of skills and adjustment techniques in preparation for the patient’s discharge. During the patient’s stay, families are encouraged to assist the patient with bathing, toileting, dressing, and exercise after instruction by staff.<br /><a href='#collapse8'>How do you keep patients and families informed?</a><br />A case manager serves as a liaison, facilitating communication between staff, families and patients. At weekly conferences, team members discuss the patient’s progress, set new goals and plan for discharge. The length of a patient’s stay varies widely. The case manager shares progress reports with patients and families at regular intervals. Meetings with the physicians, therapy team, patient and family are strongly encouraged.<br /><a href='#collapse9'>When are visitors allowed?</a><br />The primary caregiver is welcome at any time with accommodations for overnight stays if necessary. Other visitors are welcome Mon. – Fri., 5 – 8:30 p.m., and Sat. – Sun., noon – 8:30 p.m.<br /><a href='#collapse11'>Who pays for services at Eidi Family Rehabilitation Center?</a><br />Generally, services are covered by most insurance companies. We also accept patients covered under Medicare and Medicaid programs. Insurance is verified prior to admission. For questions, please call your insurance company.<br /><a href='#collapse12'>What happens on the day of discharge?</a><br />To ease the discharge transition, the case manager will work with the patient and family to arrange for continuing outpatient or in-home treatment support as indicated. Community resources are arranged prior to discharge.<br />",

      "description": "What Is Kaitlyn’s Cottage<br /> <br />There once was a grandmother with a dream.<br />Her dream was that her granddaughter, Kaitlyn, would once day have a place where she could experience life, friends and fun just like her siblings. And that her daughter and son-in-law, Kaitlyn’s primary caregivers, would be able to take time for themselves while feeling that Kaitlyn was safely being cared for and enjoying her time with friends. This grandmother envisioned a warm, safe place that was full of laughter and encouragement for everyone.<br />In 2012, the dream came to life and Kaitlyn’s Cottage opened its doors. Kaitlyn’s Cottage is a country cottage providing day, evening and overnight respite for people who live with intellectual and physical disabilities. <br />Services are provided in a warm, home environment that has a large accessible kitchen, great room with fireplace, library, activity rooms, accessible bathrooms and four private bedrooms.<br />Although located on the campus of <a href='/location/promedica-defiance-regional-hospital'>ProMedica Defiance Regional Hospital</a>, Kaitlyn’s Cottage is a non-medical respite care facility. If a participant has intensive medical needs, they will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis within the scope of our care.<br />Individuals of all ages needing respite care are welcome.<br />Services<br />Daytime, evening, weekend and overnight respite services can be scheduled on any given day or time to accommodate your family’s need. Daytime respite can range from just a few hours to an entire day. The number of participants that can be served is dependent on the special needs of each individual and the planned activities. Overnights can range from one night, a weekend, even an entire week or more. Up to four participants can stay each night.<br />Parent and Caregiver Resources<br />For our families, we offer Cottage Connections meetings. Here, you will feel like part of a community comprised of those who are experiencing the joys and challenges that all caregivers of individuals with special needs face. You will be able to relax, enjoy conversations and share with other caregivers – mothers, fathers, grandparents, siblings – who “get it.” <br />Interested in Staying at Kaitlyn's Cottage<br /><a href='/find-locations/forms/kaitlyns-cottage-interest'>Fill out interest form </a><br />Application Process<br />No one will be denied respite support based on inability to pay. With the generous donations from our community and the support of ProMedica Defiance Regional Hospital, we are able to offer respite services to our families on a sliding fee scale based on each family’s household size and income. If you have any questions about payment and billing, please don’t hesitate to contact us. We will be happy to discuss personalized payment options with you.<br />If you are interested in volunteering or donating to Kaitlyn’s Cottage, please contact us at <a href='tel:1-419-783-4411'>419-783-4411</a>. We invite you to use your skills, passions or resources to serve at Kaitlyn’s Cottage.<br /><a href='https://tourmkr.com/F1o5qPulKU' target='_blank'>Take our virtual tour</a><br /><a href='https://www.facebook.com/KaitlynsCottage/' target='_blank'></a><br /><a href='https://www.youtube.com/user/ProMedicaTV' target='_blank'></a><br />",

It is a collaborative partnership between patients, loved ones and hospital staff, to promote the concepts of Patient and Family Centered Care. <br />Council meetings are the starting point for patient and family advisors to share their perspectives on strategies, processes, and information together with hospital staff, and facilitate activities that enrich the patient and family experience during their hospital stay. The goal of the Patient and Family Advisory Council is to improve the safety and quality of patient care. Advisors can also participate in hospital councils, focus groups, and patient rounding. <br />Our PFACs serve as our richest source of capturing the voice of the customer and advocating to ensure we truly practice Patient and Family Centered Care.<br />PFAC meetings take place monthly at 6 p.m. at ProMedica Bay Park Hospital.<br />Frequently Asked Questions <br /><a href='#collapse1'>What is a Patient/Family Advisor?</a><br />Patient and family advisors are individuals who have experienced care at one of our ProMedica hospitals as either a patient or a family member, and are willing to provide input from a patient’s perspective to improve care across our healthcare system.  <br /><a href='#collapse2'>What is the expectation of this role?</a><br />Patient and family advisors volunteer their time and perspective with staff and leaders. We ask PFAC members for their input on initiatives occurring at the hospital and across the ProMedica continuum of care.  <br /><a href='#collapse3'>What is the time commitment of a Patient or Family Advisor?</a><br />Patient and family advisors can commit to as little as one two-hour meeting each month or as often as weekly patient rounding.    <br /><a href='#collapse4'>How can I sign up to be a Patient or Family Advisor?</a><br />If you are interested in joining our team, please complete <a href='https://hipaa.jotform.com/200584123984154' target='_blank'>this form</a>.

Women with dense breasts have a four to six times greater risk of developing breast cancer compared to women who don't. In addition this density makes it more likely for lumps or masses to be missed with a standard mammogram. Unlike 2-D or 3-D mammography, which uses radiation, ABUS uses sound waves to create clear ultrasound 3-D images of the breast tissue. That way, radiologists can find cancers overlooked on a mammogram or standard ultrasound...or more quickly disregard false negatives. It gives the physician hundreds of additional pictures to review along with your mammogram results - helping to detect 35.7 percent more cancers in women with dense breasts than mammography alone.",

      "description": "The ProMedica device clinic is for patients who have had a heart device implanted. This includes pacemakers, implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD), subcutaneous implantable cardioverter defibrillator (S-ICD), loop recorders and biventricular devices. It’s important to routinely check these devices to make sure they are working right and aren’t causing problems. <br />Our team is trained to check heart devices manufactured by leading companies including Abbott (formerly St. Jude Medical), Biotronik, Boston Scientific, LivaNova (formerly Sorin Group) and Medtronic.<br />    At each appointment, our experienced staff of nurses and cardiac electrophysiologists will check your device. The process is called interrogation. A specially trained nurse places a hand-held tool over your clothes on top of the ICD. The tool automatically sends the information that our team needs to:<br />    Assess if the device is working normally  <br />    Confirm the battery life is okay<br />    Determine if there have been any abnormal heart rhythm or stocks delivered (for ICDs) recorded<br />    The interrogation also includes:<br />    Perform a 4-lead ECG to monitor your heart rhythm <br />        Check the device for lead integration and signs of lead infection<br />        <br />        Some devices can be monitored wirelessly from your home. A small box sits next to your bed. Every night, it collects information from your device and automatically sends it back to our office to review and monitor. This includes abnormal rhythms, lead integrity issues and battery information.<br />        For more information about our home monitoring program, please call our office at <a href='tel:+14198423000'>419-842-3000</a>.<br />",

The farm includes several barns, walking paths, and a hoop house for indoor growing. This is part of ProMedica’s effort to encourage healthy eating and preventative care.<br />The hoop house is made of metal framing and a heavy-duty, translucent plastic film that provides solar heating during the day and protection from the elements. It is a clinical hoop house and is the second in Michigan. The hoop house features raised garden beds at various heights for children and people in wheelchairs, as well as railings and staircases for physical therapy. This will allow patients to learn how to maneuver on different turfs.<br /><iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/95fe7rYW31c'></iframe><br />Contact Us<br />Email: <a href='mailto:promedica.farms@promedica.org'>promedica.farms@promedica.org</a><br /><a href='/assets/documents/promedica_farms_volunteering.pdf' target='_blank'> Volunteer at ProMedica Farms </a><br />Images <br /><a href='/assets/images/style-library/locations/promedica-farms1.jpg'><img src='/assets/images/style-library/locations/promedica-farms1.jpg' alt='Hoop House' /></a><br /><br />Hoop House<br /><a href='/assets/images/style-library/locations/promedica-farms2.jpg'><img src='/assets/images/style-library/locations/promedica-farms2.jpg' alt='Inside of ProMedica Farms' /></a><br /><br />Inside of ProMedica Farms<br /><a href='/assets/images/style-library/locations/promedica-farms3.jpg'><img src='/assets/images/style-library/locations/promedica-farms3.jpg' alt='Outside of ProMedica Farms' /></a><br /><br />Outside of ProMedica Farms<br /><a href='/assets/images/style-library/locations/promedica-farms4.jpg'><img src='/assets/images/style-library/locations/promedica-farms4.jpg' alt='ProMedica Farms Overview ' /></a><br /><br />ProMedica Farms Overview <br />The Veggie Mobile<br />The <a href='http://lenaweeveggiemobile.com/#home' target>Veggie Mobile </a>provides a solution to address the availability of local, healthy food throughout Lenawee County, by supporting local agricultural producers and increasing the availability of reasonably priced, nutrient dense, fresh food. By empowering the community to support local producers, the project establishes a source of healthy, farm-to-fork, food retail outlets in food deserts and low-income areas.<br />In 2014, the program took another step toward reducing food insecurity; a SNAP machine was obtained to extend SNAP recipients' purchasing power and provider further access to fresh fruits and vegetables for low-income residents of Lenawee County. In 2017, the Veggie Mobile began supporting Tecumseh students through the Back Pack Buddies program, which allows 120 students to receive fruit and snacks to supplement meals on weekends.<br /><a href='/assets/documents/veggie_mobile_schedule.pdf' target='_blank'> View the Veggie Mobile Schedule </a><br />",

It is a collaborative partnership between patients, loved ones and hospital staff, to promote the concepts of Patient and Family Centered Care. <br />Council meetings are the starting point for patient and family advisors to share their perspectives on strategies, processes, and information together with hospital staff, and facilitate activities that enrich the patient and family experience during their hospital stay. The goal of the Patient and Family Advisory Council is to improve the safety and quality of patient care. Advisors can also participate in hospital councils, focus groups, and patient rounding. <br />Our PFACs serve as our richest source of capturing the voice of the customer and advocating to ensure we truly practice Patient and Family Centered Care.<br />PFAC meetings take place quarterly at noon at ProMedica Flower Hospital.<br />Frequently Asked Questions <br /><a href='#collapse1'>What is a Patient/Family Advisor?</a><br />Patient and family advisors are individuals who have experienced care at one of our ProMedica hospitals as either a patient or a family member, and are willing to provide input from a patient’s perspective to improve care across our healthcare system.  <br /><a href='#collapse2'>What is the expectation of this role?</a><br />Patient and family advisors volunteer their time and perspective with staff and leaders. We ask PFAC members for their input on initiatives occurring at the hospital and across the ProMedica continuum of care.  <br /><a href='#collapse3'>What is the time commitment of a Patient or Family Advisor?</a><br />Patient and family advisors can commit to as little as one two-hour meeting each month or as often as weekly patient rounding.    <br /><a href='#collapse4'>How can I sign up to be a Patient or Family Advisor?</a><br />If you are interested in joining our team, please complete <a href='https://hipaa.jotform.com/200584123984154' target='_blank'>this form</a>.

We are a 10 station dialysis unit able to accommodate 36 patients; utilizing two shifts per day. <br />Receiving hemodialysis at the center offers several benefits to patients, including an opportunity to socialize with staff and other patients, consistency with treatment plans and a personalized care team. The center provides patient-centered care by supporting patients with more than just dialysis treatments. The dialysis team works with patients and their families to arrange specialty appointments, manage prescription medications, provide assistance with understanding insurance coverages and benefits associated with end stage renal failure, and arranging transient visits to encourage travel. <br />Patients are educated along the way regarding every aspect of their disease process. Our team of registered nurses provide monthly education and ongoing learning opportunities that are individualized to meet each patient’s needs. Our team works directly with social workers and care navigators at local hospitals to ensure patient safety and provide quality transitions of care following hospitalizations.  <br />The center complies with all regulatory standards and is accredited by Joint Commission and Ohio Department of Health. In 2021, the center received a 3-Star Quality Rating from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.<br />",

Hayes (a Fremont resident), pledged $50,000 of her money, as well as her home, toward the construction of ProMedica Memorial Hospital. This gift, however, could only be realized provided the citizens of Fremont raise an additional $75,000 for the hospital.<br />The matter rested until 1915 when members of the community went into action. Over the course of six days in October of that year, a whirlwind fundraising campaign known as “Fremont Never Fails” took place. The campaign resulted in $99,672 raised in addition to Mary Miller Hayes' initial $50,000 endowment.<br />Construction of Memorial Hospital began on August 14, 1916 on land donated by Mary Miller Hayes and her husband, Col. Webb C. Hayes, second son of President Rutherford B. Hayes. The hospital opened its doors on October 4, 1918.<br />Today, ProMedica Memorial Hospital is a 43 licensed-bed hospital that continues to offer comprehensive, compassionate medical care to the communities we serve.",

To accommodate that desire, ProMedica Monroe Regional Hospital has completely renovated its obstetrical unit. <br />The hospital offers expectant parents six spacious, luxuriously appointed labor-delivery-recovery rooms, commonly known as birthing suites. Filled with homelike furnishings and soft lighting, the birthing suites provide an atmosphere that's warm and comfortable. And they are large enough to allow family members to share in the joy and wonder of birth. <br />While the birthing suites resemble a home bedroom, all the modern equipment needed to ensure the health of the mother and child is in place. <br /><br /><br />In addition to large, more comfortable accommodations, the birthing suites allow the mother to remain in one place during all phases of the birth. Because you don't have to move from room to room, the family can spend the first precious hours of life with its newest member in a tranquil comfortable setting.<br /><br /><br /> ProMedica Monroe Regional Hospital is also a proud member of the <a target='_blank' href='http://www.greatstartmonroe.org/'>Monroe County Great Start Collaborative,</a> which promotes and supports early childhood issues.<br /><br /><a href='https://www.mom365.com/babyphotography/mi/promedica-monroe-regional-hospital.aspx'>Check out our online baby gallery!</a>",

      "description": "Palliative care is specialized care for patients living with serious illnesses. It is patient-centered and focused on providing relief from the physical and emotional symptoms often associated with disease progression.<br />Palliative care can be delivered in conjunction with curative care and treatment plans are created to match the goals of care expressed by the patient and family, regardless of the stage of disease.<br />Palliative care is based on the patient’s needs, not the patient’s prognosis. In this way, together, we can develop a personalized plan of care focused on your individual goals. Symptoms from a serious/end stage illness that may benefit from palliative care include:<br /> Pain<br />Shortness of breath<br />Constipation<br />Diarrhea<br />Nausea<br />Loss of appetite<br />Fatigue<br />Difficulty sleeping<br />Anxiety and/or Depression<br />Increased confusion<br />Palliative Medicine may also assist with:<br />Education about and completion of Advanced Directives<br />Coordination across various care settings (transitions of care)<br />Disease specific education<br />Access to local community resources<br />",

      "description": "The Finnegan Family Autism Center works to set standards to diagnose autism early, offer options for individualized interventions and provide continued care and support. The center is home to the Autism Early Learning Program, as well as Avenues for Autism and iTaalk. The University of Toledo Occupational Therapy Department supports open play sessions in our indoor and outdoor play/sensory areas.<br />Autism Early Learning Program <br />When your child is diagnosed with <a href='/services-and-conditions/autism'>autism spectrum disorder</a>, you want solutions and services that address their unique needs. <br />Located in the ProMedica Finnegan Family Autism Center, the Autism Early Learning Program offers early intensive behavioral intervention services for children with autism utilizing Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA). The program operates year-around with options for full day and partial day services from the age of diagnosis through 6 years. <br />Each child’s program is individualized with intervention focusing on building skills in the following areas: communication, behavior, play, socialization, adaptive, and developmentally appropriate skills acquisition. Services are implemented in classroom or therapy settings with 1:1 ratios and options for group learning as appropriate. Dependent on a child’s skills and needs, group learning settings with a behavior analytic approach are also available. Parent training and participation are integral to every child’s success and are mandatory across all programs.<br />Services at the Autism Early Learning Program are provided by board certified behavior analysts (BCBA) and center-based behavior technicians. Additional therapy services such as speech and language therapy can also be accessed at the center. All services are provided in accordance with Ohio licensure laws.<br />Enrolling in the Autism Early Learning Program <br />If you think your child would benefit from the Autism Early Learning Program, our staff can assess your child’s unique needs to determine how best we can support your family.<br />If we believe our program will help you, we’ll arrange an appointment with one of our team members. If we don’t think the program is a good match for your situation, we’ll recommend other options or provide referrals.<br />  Call us to enroll at 419-291-7080.<br />  <br /><a href='#collapse1'>Parent Involvement</a><br />  Our goal is to provide the best services possible for children with autism. We encourage you to be an active participant in your child’s - intervention. This includes:<br />  Daily written correspondence with your child’s team.<br />  Home visits twice a year by your child’s behavior analyst.<br />  Parent training participation as indicated in your child’s individualized treatment plan. This may include observation of your child interacting with their team at the center and you demonstrating and practicing skills with your child.<br /><a href='#collapse2'>Insurance Coverage and Costs</a><br />  The Autism Early Learning Program accepts most insurance plans. Potential costs would be dependent upon your insurance plan. Please check with your health plan for specific coverage information.<br />  We are also an approved Ohio Department of Education Autism Scholarship provider. Outside agencies and school districts may also contract for program services.<br />  <br /><a href='#collapse3'>Operational Hours</a><br />ProMedica’s Autism Early Learning Program does operate year-round. Our offices are open 8 a.m. to 4:30 p.m., Monday through Friday. ABA services typically take place between the hours of 8:30 a.m. – 4 p.m.<br />Understanding Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA)<br />Our Autism Early Learning Program team at the Finnegan Family Autism Center is trained in applied behavior analysis (ABA), a science that uses behavioral techniques to teach children basic and complex skills. It works by reinforcing appropriate behavior while decreasing or eliminating interfering behavior. Opportunities for success are built into the program and adjustments are made as children progress, helping them function better in the world.<br />The goal of ABA is to go from a 1:1, highly structured teaching environment to a less structured teaching environment in a small group. Then, to go to a naturalistic, large group general education setting.<br />While using the principles of ABA, we systematically teach and reinforce small, measurable and attainable units of targeted skills. Every skill (small or complex) is broken down into small steps. Each step is practiced until success is achieved.<br />",

The goal of the Patient and Family Advisory Council is to improve the safety and quality of patient care. Advisors can also participate in hospital councils, focus groups, and patient rounding. <br />Our PFACs serve as our richest source of capturing the voice of the customer and advocating to ensure we truly practice Patient and Family Centered Care.<br />PFAC meetings take place the second Thursday of every month from 6 - 8 p.m. at ProMedica Toledo Hospital.<br />Frequently Asked Questions <br /><a href='#collapse1'>What is a Patient/Family Advisor?</a><br />Patient and family advisors are individuals who have experienced care at one of our ProMedica hospitals as either a patient or a family member, and are willing to provide input from a patient’s perspective to improve care across our healthcare system.  <br /><a href='#collapse2'>What is the expectation of this role?</a><br />Patient and family advisors volunteer their time and perspective with staff and leaders.

We are focused on helping people restore pain-free mobility, whether it is overcoming impairments limiting strength, balance, and flexibility, or helping provide tips and tools for improved independence with daily dressing, bathing, and eating.<br />Special services:<br />Pelvic Health<br />You're not alone in this. One in three women of child-bearing age experiences chronic pelvic pain and one in five women experiences pelvic floor disorder.<br />Pelvic health issues are common, but not normal. They aren’t just part of aging or having children. Unfortunately, many people put up with it or suffer in silence because they aren’t comfortable talking about it, even with their doctor. If you think you may have a pelvic health issue, we’re here to help.<br />Pelvic health issues can cause a variety of symptoms in women and men. Here are some of the symptoms associated with pelvic conditions:<br />    Severe steady or intermittent pain in the pelvic area<br />    Pain during or after intercourse<br />    Pain while having a bowel movement or urinating<br />    Frequent or urgent urination<br />    Leakage or passage of urine or feces<br />    Constipation<br />LSVT BIG<br />The LSVT BIG program works with patients to improve self-care, walking and other tasks. By using the simple cuing and demonstration, patient and therapist work together to 're-calibrate' movement to a more normal size. <br />Each session will include research backed LSVT BIG exercises and practice of personalized functional tasks. In only four weeks of time, patients can expect to notice BIG changes in their movement that will make everyday life easier and more enjoyable.<br />More Services at this Location<br />    Aquatic Therapy<br />    Arthritis Aquatics Classes<br />    Balance Reeducation<br />    Body Mechanics &amp; Postural Reeducation<br />    Cranial-Sacral Therapy<br />    Cognitive Evaluations<br />    Functional Dry Needling<br />    Gait Analysis &amp; Retraining<br />    Geriatric Rehabilitation<br />    Lymphedema: Complete Decongestive Therapy<br />    Pediatric Feeding &amp; Swallowing<br />    Swallow Studies<br />    Speech Rehabilitation<br />    Stroke Rehabilitation<br />    Vocal Cord Paralysis/Hoarseness<br />",

      "description": "The Cullen Center offers outpatient pediatric behavioral health assessments, counseling and group support (no psychiatric services). We are a member of the <a href='https://www.nctsn.org/' target='_blank'>National Child Traumatic Stress Network (NCTSN)</a>.<br />We have a community that has the knowledge, resources, and commitment to support children, teens and their families who have experienced traumatic events. Our vision is to help them to heal and reclaim their lives. Several examples of trauma are:<br />Physical, sexual, or psychological abuse or neglect<br />Witnessing violence in the home, school or community<br />Sudden or violent loss of a family member or friend<br />Victim of crime<br />Serious accidents or life-threatening illness<br />Accident, fire, injury or other disaster<br />Natural or technological disasters or terrorism<br />Bullying/cyberbullying<br />Military family-related stressors (e.g., deployment, parental loss or injury)<br />Without treatment, repeated childhood exposure to traumatic events can affect the brain and nervous system and increase health-risk behaviors (e.g., smoking, eating disorders, substance use, and high-risk activities). Research shows that child trauma survivors can be more likely to have long-term health problems (e.g., diabetes and heart disease) or to die at an earlier age. Traumatic stress can also lead to increased use of health and mental health services and increased involvement with the child welfare and<br />juvenile justice systems. Adult survivors of traumatic events may also have difficulty in establishing fulfilling relationships and maintaining employment.<br />The mission of The Cullen Center is to recognize the family as an expert and develop mutually respectful and equal partnerships among trauma survivors, families and professionals. Part of our job as experts is to find the best possible tools available to help families reclaim their lives. We accomplish through evidence-based and best practice trauma-focused counseling and education. A therapy model is considered evidence-based when it has been tested and proven to improve children’s performance and reduce children’s trauma-related symptoms.<br />Following are therapies we currently provide are:<br />Trauma-focused Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (TF-CBT)<br />Child Parent Psychotherapy (CPP)<br />Attachment, Regulation Competency therapy (ARC)<br />Theraplay and Theraplay techniques<br />STRONG Families therapy<br />Cognitive Processing Therapy (CPT)<br />Trauma-informed Parenting (TIP)<br />Hip Hop HEALS (H3<br />)<br />Individual and family counseling<br />In addition, trauma-informed individual and family interventions such as:<br />Support<br />Child and family education<br />Crisis intervention<br />Other services we provide for the community include:<br />Trauma-informed consultation<br />Community education<br />ACCESSING OUR SERVICES<br />Our goal is to determine if our services will best meet your child’s needs. Please contact our office at 419-291-7919 so we can conduct a brief phone screening to determine appropriateness.<br />If services is deemed suitable, then we will then make an appointment for you to attend a new client orientation to complete initial paperwork and to learn about The Cullen Center and trauma-focused therapy. Following the orientation, we will schedule your child for a diagnostic assessment. While we may have suggestions for which therapist we think may be a good fit for your child, we do appreciate your input.<br />Begin to heal. Your child, with the support of our experts, treatment, information and you, can reclaim childhood and continue growing toward a healthy life.",
