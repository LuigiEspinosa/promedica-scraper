We serve patients from the 21-county geographic regions of northwest Ohio and southeast Michigan. Although we are a pediatric office, our Cystic Fibrosis Center provides care for pediatric and adult patients. We use a multi-disciplinary approach to meet all of your cystic fibrosis related care needs. Our care team consists of pediatric and adult physicians, nurse coordinators, social workers, dieticians, respiratory therapists and research coordinators. To provide you with the best patient outcomes, our CF Center participates in the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation Patient Registry. This Registry tracks patient outcomes, enabling informed decision making about quality improvement and standardized care for patients with CF.</p> \n\n\n<p>Our long-established program has also received Quality Improvement Awards from the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation for sustaining quality improvement work that has led to better health outcomes for people with cystic fibrosis. </p>\n\n\n<p>In 2006, a robust clinical research program was developed within our Cystic Fibrosis Care Center, in conjunction with the Cystic Fibrosis Therapeutics Development Network (TDN). The TDN was created by the CF Foundation and is one of the largest CF clinical networks in the world, bringing together experts from across the country to evaluate the safety and efficacy of new CF therapies. Our center is currently enrolling patients in research studies aimed at developing new gene-targeted therapies to correct the basic defect that causes cystic fibrosis. By working in collaboration with the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation and industry sponsors, we hope to one-day find a cure for CF.</p>\n<hr>\n<h4>Contact </h4>\n<p><strong>Lead Research Coordinator:</strong> Kelly Hoot, RN, BSN - <a href=\"mailto:Kelly.hoot@promedica.org\">Kelly.hoot@promedica.org</a><br> \n<strong>Adult Coordinator:</strong> Amanda Schreiner RN, BSN - <a href=\"mailto:Amanda.schreiner@promedica.org\">Amanda.schreiner@promedica.org</a><br> \n<strong>Pediatric Coordinator:</strong> Tyger Adoure-Zehaim RN, BSN - <a href=\"mailto:Tyger.Adoure-Zehaim@promedica.org \">Tyger.Adoure-Zehaim@promedica.org</a></p> \n</div>",

This includes pacemakers, implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD), subcutaneous implantable cardioverter defibrillator (S-ICD), loop recorders and biventricular devices. It’s important to routinely check these devices to make sure they are working right and aren’t causing problems. </p>\n<p>Our team is trained to check heart devices manufactured by leading companies including Abbott (formerly St. Jude Medical), Biotronik, Boston Scientific, LivaNova (formerly Sorin Group) and Medtronic.</p>\n<ul class=\"standard-list module\">\n    At each appointment, our experienced staff of nurses and cardiac electrophysiologists will check your device. The process is called interrogation. A specially trained nurse places a hand-held tool over your clothes on top of the ICD.

The program operates year-around with options for full day and partial day services from the age of diagnosis through 6 years. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Each child’s program is individualized with intervention focusing on building skills in the following areas: communication, behavior, play, socialization, adaptive, and developmentally appropriate skills acquisition. Services are implemented in classroom or therapy settings with 1:1 ratios and options for group learning as appropriate. Dependent on a child’s skills and needs, group learning settings with a behavior analytic approach are also available. Parent training and participation are integral to every child’s success and are mandatory across all programs.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Services at the Autism Early Learning Program are provided by board certified behavior analysts (BCBA) and center-based behavior technicians. Additional therapy services such as speech and language therapy can also be accessed at the center.

The center is home to the Autism Early Learning Program, as well as Avenues for Autism and iTaalk. The University of Toledo Occupational Therapy Department supports open play sessions in our indoor and outdoor play/sensory areas.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<h2>Autism Early Learning Program </h2>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>When your child is diagnosed with <a href=\"/services-and-conditions/autism\">autism spectrum disorder</a>, you want solutions and services that address their unique needs. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Located in the ProMedica Finnegan Family Autism Center, the Autism Early Learning Program offers early intensive behavioral intervention services for children with autism utilizing Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA). The program operates year-around with options for full day and partial day services from the age of diagnosis through 6 years. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Each child’s program is individualized with intervention focusing on building skills in the following areas: communication, behavior, play, socialization, adaptive, and developmentally appropriate skills acquisition. Services are implemented in classroom or therapy settings with 1:1 ratios and options for group learning as appropriate. Dependent on a child’s skills and needs, group learning settings with a behavior analytic approach are also available. Parent training and participation are integral to every child’s success and are mandatory across all programs.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Services at the Autism Early Learning Program are provided by board certified behavior analysts (BCBA) and center-based behavior technicians. Additional therapy services such as speech and language therapy can also be accessed at the center. All services are provided in accordance with Ohio licensure laws.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<h3>Enrolling in the Autism Early Learning Program</h3> \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>If you think your child would benefit from the Autism Early Learning Program, our staff can assess your child’s unique needs to determine how best we can support your family.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>If we believe our program will help you, we’ll arrange an appointment with one of our team members.

The program operates year-around with options for full day and partial day services from the age of diagnosis through 6 years. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Each child’s program is individualized with intervention focusing on building skills in the following areas: communication, behavior, play, socialization, adaptive, and developmentally appropriate skills acquisition. Services are implemented in classroom or therapy settings with 1:1 ratios and options for group learning as appropriate. Dependent on a child’s skills and needs, group learning settings with a behavior analytic approach are also available. Parent training and participation are integral to every child’s success and are mandatory across all programs.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Services at the Autism Early Learning Program are provided by board certified behavior analysts (BCBA) and center-based behavior technicians. Additional therapy services such as speech and language therapy can also be accessed at the center.

The center is home to the Autism Early Learning Program, as well as Avenues for Autism and iTaalk. The University of Toledo Occupational Therapy Department supports open play sessions in our indoor and outdoor play/sensory areas.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<h2>Autism Early Learning Program </h2>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>When your child is diagnosed with <a href=\"/services-and-conditions/autism\">autism spectrum disorder</a>, you want solutions and services that address their unique needs. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Located in the ProMedica Finnegan Family Autism Center, the Autism Early Learning Program offers early intensive behavioral intervention services for children with autism utilizing Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA). The program operates year-around with options for full day and partial day services from the age of diagnosis through 6 years. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Each child’s program is individualized with intervention focusing on building skills in the following areas: communication, behavior, play, socialization, adaptive, and developmentally appropriate skills acquisition. Services are implemented in classroom or therapy settings with 1:1 ratios and options for group learning as appropriate. Dependent on a child’s skills and needs, group learning settings with a behavior analytic approach are also available. Parent training and participation are integral to every child’s success and are mandatory across all programs.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Services at the Autism Early Learning Program are provided by board certified behavior analysts (BCBA) and center-based behavior technicians. Additional therapy services such as speech and language therapy can also be accessed at the center. All services are provided in accordance with Ohio licensure laws.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<h3>Enrolling in the Autism Early Learning Program</h3> \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>If you think your child would benefit from the Autism Early Learning Program, our staff can assess your child’s unique needs to determine how best we can support your family.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>If we believe our program will help you, we’ll arrange an appointment with one of our team members.
