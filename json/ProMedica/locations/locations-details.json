We serve patients from the 21-county geographic regions of northwest Ohio and southeast Michigan. Although we are a pediatric office, our Cystic Fibrosis Center provides care for pediatric and adult patients. We use a multi-disciplinary approach to meet all of your cystic fibrosis related care needs. Our care team consists of pediatric and adult physicians, nurse coordinators, social workers, dieticians, respiratory therapists and research coordinators. To provide you with the best patient outcomes, our CF Center participates in the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation Patient Registry. This Registry tracks patient outcomes, enabling informed decision making about quality improvement and standardized care for patients with CF.</p> \n\n\n<p>Our long-established program has also received Quality Improvement Awards from the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation for sustaining quality improvement work that has led to better health outcomes for people with cystic fibrosis. </p>\n\n\n<p>In 2006, a robust clinical research program was developed within our Cystic Fibrosis Care Center, in conjunction with the Cystic Fibrosis Therapeutics Development Network (TDN). The TDN was created by the CF Foundation and is one of the largest CF clinical networks in the world, bringing together experts from across the country to evaluate the safety and efficacy of new CF therapies. Our center is currently enrolling patients in research studies aimed at developing new gene-targeted therapies to correct the basic defect that causes cystic fibrosis. By working in collaboration with the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation and industry sponsors, we hope to one-day find a cure for CF.</p>\n<hr>\n<h4>Contact </h4>\n<p><strong>Lead Research Coordinator:</strong> Kelly Hoot, RN, BSN - <a href=\"mailto:Kelly.hoot@promedica.org\">Kelly.hoot@promedica.org</a><br> \n<strong>Adult Coordinator:</strong> Amanda Schreiner RN, BSN - <a href=\"mailto:Amanda.schreiner@promedica.org\">Amanda.schreiner@promedica.org</a><br> \n<strong>Pediatric Coordinator:</strong> Tyger Adoure-Zehaim RN, BSN - <a href=\"mailto:Tyger.Adoure-Zehaim@promedica.org \">Tyger.Adoure-Zehaim@promedica.org</a></p> \n</div>",

We serve patients from the 21-county geographic regions of northwest Ohio and southeast Michigan. Although we are a pediatric office, our Cystic Fibrosis Center provides care for pediatric and adult patients. We use a multi-disciplinary approach to meet all of your cystic fibrosis related care needs. Our care team consists of pediatric and adult physicians, nurse coordinators, social workers, dieticians, respiratory therapists and research coordinators. To provide you with the best patient outcomes, our CF Center participates in the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation Patient Registry. This Registry tracks patient outcomes, enabling informed decision making about quality improvement and standardized care for patients with CF.</p> \n\n\n<p>Our long-established program has also received Quality Improvement Awards from the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation for sustaining quality improvement work that has led to better health outcomes for people with cystic fibrosis. </p>\n\n\n<p>In 2006, a robust clinical research program was developed within our Cystic Fibrosis Care Center, in conjunction with the Cystic Fibrosis Therapeutics Development Network (TDN). The TDN was created by the CF Foundation and is one of the largest CF clinical networks in the world, bringing together experts from across the country to evaluate the safety and efficacy of new CF therapies. Our center is currently enrolling patients in research studies aimed at developing new gene-targeted therapies to correct the basic defect that causes cystic fibrosis.

We serve patients from the 21-county geographic regions of northwest Ohio and southeast Michigan. Although we are a pediatric office, our Cystic Fibrosis Center provides care for pediatric and adult patients. We use a multi-disciplinary approach to meet all of your cystic fibrosis related care needs. Our care team consists of pediatric and adult physicians, nurse coordinators, social workers, dieticians, respiratory therapists and research coordinators. To provide you with the best patient outcomes, our CF Center participates in the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation Patient Registry. This Registry tracks patient outcomes, enabling informed decision making about quality improvement and standardized care for patients with CF.</p> \n\n\n<p>Our long-established program has also received Quality Improvement Awards from the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation for sustaining quality improvement work that has led to better health outcomes for people with cystic fibrosis. </p>\n\n\n<p>In 2006, a robust clinical research program was developed within our Cystic Fibrosis Care Center, in conjunction with the Cystic Fibrosis Therapeutics Development Network (TDN). The TDN was created by the CF Foundation and is one of the largest CF clinical networks in the world, bringing together experts from across the country to evaluate the safety and efficacy of new CF therapies. Our center is currently enrolling patients in research studies aimed at developing new gene-targeted therapies to correct the basic defect that causes cystic fibrosis. By working in collaboration with the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation and industry sponsors, we hope to one-day find a cure for CF.</p>\n<hr>\n<h4>Contact </h4>\n<p><strong>Lead Research Coordinator:</strong> Kelly Hoot, RN, BSN - <a href=\"mailto:Kelly.hoot@promedica.org\">Kelly.hoot@promedica.org</a><br> \n<strong>Adult Coordinator:</strong> Amanda Schreiner RN, BSN - <a href=\"mailto:Amanda.schreiner@promedica.org\">Amanda.schreiner@promedica.org</a><br> \n<strong>Pediatric Coordinator:</strong> Tyger Adoure-Zehaim RN, BSN - <a href=\"mailto:Tyger.Adoure-Zehaim@promedica.org \">Tyger.Adoure-Zehaim@promedica.org</a></p> \n</div>",

It is a collaborative partnership between patients, loved ones and hospital staff, to promote the concepts of Patient and Family Centered Care. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Council meetings are the starting point for patient and family advisors to share their perspectives on strategies, processes, and information together with hospital staff, and facilitate activities that enrich the patient and family experience during their hospital stay. The goal of the Patient and Family Advisory Council is to improve the safety and quality of patient care. Advisors can also participate in hospital councils, focus groups, and patient rounding.</p> \n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Our PFACs serve as our richest source of capturing the voice of the customer and advocating to ensure we truly practice Patient and Family Centered Care.</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>PFAC meetings take place monthly at 6 p.m. at ProMedica Bay Park Hospital.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"panel-group\" id=\"accordion\" role=\"tablist\" aria-multiselectable=\"true\">\n<h3>Frequently Asked Questions </h3>\n<div class=\"panel panel-default\">\n<div class=\"panel-heading\" role=\"tab\" id=\"heading1\">\n<h3 class=\"panel-title\"><a class=\"collapsed\" role=\"button\" data-toggle=\"collapse\" data-parent=\"#accordion\" href=\"#collapse1\" aria-expanded=\"false\" aria-controls=\"collapse1\">What is a Patient/Family Advisor?</a></h3>\n</div>\n<div id=\"collapse1\" class=\"panel-collapse collapse\" role=\"tabpanel\" aria-labelledby=\"heading1\">\n<div class=\"panel-body\">\n<p>Patient and family advisors are individuals who have experienced care at one of our ProMedica hospitals as either a patient or a family member, and are willing to provide input from a patient’s perspective to improve care across our healthcare system.</p>  \n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"panel panel-default\">\n<div class=\"panel-heading\" role=\"tab\" id=\"heading2\">\n<h3 class=\"panel-title\"><a class=\"collapsed\" role=\"button\" data-toggle=\"collapse\" data-parent=\"#accordion\" href=\"#collapse2\" aria-expanded=\"false\" aria-controls=\"collapse2\">What is the expectation of this role?</a></h3>\n</div>\n<div id=\"collapse2\" class=\"panel-collapse collapse\" role=\"tabpanel\" aria-labelledby=\"heading2\">\n<div class=\"panel-body\">\n<p>Patient and family advisors volunteer their time and perspective with staff and leaders.

It is patient-centered and focused on providing relief from the physical and emotional symptoms often associated with disease progression.</p>\n\n\n<p>Palliative care can be delivered in conjunction with curative care and treatment plans are created to match the goals of care expressed by the patient and family, regardless of the stage of disease.</p>\n\n\n<p>Palliative care is based on the patient’s needs, not the patient’s prognosis. In this way, together, we can develop a personalized plan of care focused on your individual goals.
