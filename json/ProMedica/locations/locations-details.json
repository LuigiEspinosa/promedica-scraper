Our care team consists of pediatric and adult physicians, nurse coordinators, social workers, dieticians, respiratory therapists and research coordinators. To provide you with the best patient outcomes, our CF Center participates in the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation Patient Registry. This Registry tracks patient outcomes, enabling informed decision making about quality improvement and standardized care for patients with CF.</p> \n\n\n<p>Our long-established program has also received Quality Improvement Awards from the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation for sustaining quality improvement work that has led to better health outcomes for people with cystic fibrosis. </p>\n\n\n<p>In 2006, a robust clinical research program was developed within our Cystic Fibrosis Care Center, in conjunction with the Cystic Fibrosis Therapeutics Development Network (TDN). The TDN was created by the CF Foundation and is one of the largest CF clinical networks in the world, bringing together experts from across the country to evaluate the safety and efficacy of new CF therapies. Our center is currently enrolling patients in research studies aimed at developing new gene-targeted therapies to correct the basic defect that causes cystic fibrosis. By working in collaboration with the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation and industry sponsors, we hope to one-day find a cure for CF.</p>\n<hr>\n<h4>Contact </h4>\n<p><strong>Lead Research Coordinator:</strong> Kelly Hoot, RN, BSN - <a href=\"mailto:Kelly.hoot@promedica.org\">Kelly.hoot@promedica.org</a><br> \n<strong>Adult Coordinator:</strong> Amanda Schreiner RN, BSN - <a href=\"mailto:Amanda.schreiner@promedica.org\">Amanda.schreiner@promedica.org</a><br> \n<strong>Pediatric Coordinator:</strong> Tyger Adoure-Zehaim RN, BSN - <a href=\"mailto:Tyger.Adoure-Zehaim@promedica.org \">Tyger.Adoure-Zehaim@promedica.org</a></p> \n</div>",

And that her daughter and son-in-law, Kaitlyn’s primary caregivers, would be able to take time for themselves while feeling that Kaitlyn was safely being cared for and enjoying her time with friends. This grandmother envisioned a warm, safe place that was full of laughter and encouragement for everyone.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>In 2012, the dream came to life and Kaitlyn’s Cottage opened its doors. Kaitlyn’s Cottage is a country cottage providing day, evening and overnight respite for people who live with intellectual and physical disabilities.</p> \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Services are provided in a warm, home environment that has a large accessible kitchen, great room with fireplace, library, activity rooms, accessible bathrooms and four private bedrooms.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Although located on the campus of <a href=\"/location/promedica-defiance-regional-hospital\">ProMedica Defiance Regional Hospital</a>, Kaitlyn’s Cottage is a non-medical respite care facility. If a participant has intensive medical needs, they will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis within the scope of our care.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Individuals of all ages needing respite care are welcome.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<h3>Services</h3>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Daytime, evening, weekend and overnight respite services can be scheduled on any given day or time to accommodate your family’s need. Daytime respite can range from just a few hours to an entire day. The number of participants that can be served is dependent on the special needs of each individual and the planned activities. Overnights can range from one night, a weekend, even an entire week or more. Up to four participants can stay each night.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<h3>Parent and Caregiver Resources</h3>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>For our families, we offer Cottage Connections meetings. Here, you will feel like part of a community comprised of those who are experiencing the joys and challenges that all caregivers of individuals with special needs face. You will be able to relax, enjoy conversations and share with other caregivers – mothers, fathers, grandparents, siblings – who “get it.” </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"divider-green\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<h2>Interested in Staying at Kaitlyn's Cottage</h2>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"/find-locations/forms/kaitlyns-cottage-interest\" class=\"btn btn-primary\">Fill out interest form </a></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<hr>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<h4>Application Process</h4>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>No one will be denied respite support based on inability to pay. With the generous donations from our community and the support of ProMedica Defiance Regional Hospital, we are able to offer respite services to our families on a sliding fee scale based on each family’s household size and income. If you have any questions about payment and billing, please don’t hesitate to contact us. We will be happy to discuss personalized payment options with you.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>If you are interested in volunteering or donating to Kaitlyn’s Cottage, please contact us at <a href=\"tel:1-419-783-4411\">419-783-4411</a>.

Advisors can also participate in hospital councils, focus groups, and patient rounding.</p> \n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Our PFACs serve as our richest source of capturing the voice of the customer and advocating to ensure we truly practice Patient and Family Centered Care.</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>PFAC meetings take place monthly at 6 p.m. at ProMedica Bay Park Hospital.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"panel-group\" id=\"accordion\" role=\"tablist\" aria-multiselectable=\"true\">\n<h3>Frequently Asked Questions </h3>\n<div class=\"panel panel-default\">\n<div class=\"panel-heading\" role=\"tab\" id=\"heading1\">\n<h3 class=\"panel-title\"><a class=\"collapsed\" role=\"button\" data-toggle=\"collapse\" data-parent=\"#accordion\" href=\"#collapse1\" aria-expanded=\"false\" aria-controls=\"collapse1\">What is a Patient/Family Advisor?</a></h3>\n</div>\n<div id=\"collapse1\" class=\"panel-collapse collapse\" role=\"tabpanel\" aria-labelledby=\"heading1\">\n<div class=\"panel-body\">\n<p>Patient and family advisors are individuals who have experienced care at one of our ProMedica hospitals as either a patient or a family member, and are willing to provide input from a patient’s perspective to improve care across our healthcare system.</p>  \n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"panel panel-default\">\n<div class=\"panel-heading\" role=\"tab\" id=\"heading2\">\n<h3 class=\"panel-title\"><a class=\"collapsed\" role=\"button\" data-toggle=\"collapse\" data-parent=\"#accordion\" href=\"#collapse2\" aria-expanded=\"false\" aria-controls=\"collapse2\">What is the expectation of this role?</a></h3>\n</div>\n<div id=\"collapse2\" class=\"panel-collapse collapse\" role=\"tabpanel\" aria-labelledby=\"heading2\">\n<div class=\"panel-body\">\n<p>Patient and family advisors volunteer their time and perspective with staff and leaders.

Women with dense breasts have a four to six times greater risk of developing breast cancer compared to women who don't. In addition this density makes it more likely for lumps or masses to be missed with a standard mammogram. Unlike 2-D or 3-D mammography, which uses radiation, ABUS uses sound waves to create clear ultrasound 3-D images of the breast tissue. That way, radiologists can find cancers overlooked on a mammogram or standard ultrasound...or more quickly disregard false negatives. It gives the physician hundreds of additional pictures to review along with your mammogram results - helping to detect 35.7 percent more cancers in women with dense breasts than mammography alone. </p></div>",

This includes pacemakers, implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD), subcutaneous implantable cardioverter defibrillator (S-ICD), loop recorders and biventricular devices. It’s important to routinely check these devices to make sure they are working right and aren’t causing problems. </p>\n<p>Our team is trained to check heart devices manufactured by leading companies including Abbott (formerly St. Jude Medical), Biotronik, Boston Scientific, LivaNova (formerly Sorin Group) and Medtronic.</p>\n<ul class=\"standard-list module\">\n    At each appointment, our experienced staff of nurses and cardiac electrophysiologists will check your device. The process is called interrogation. A specially trained nurse places a hand-held tool over your clothes on top of the ICD. The tool automatically sends the information that our team needs to:\n    <li>Assess if the device is working normally  </li>\n    <li>Confirm the battery life is okay</li>\n    <li>Determine if there have been any abnormal heart rhythm or stocks delivered (for ICDs) recorded</li>\n</ul>\n<ul class=\"standard-list module\">\n    The interrogation also includes:\n    <ul>Perform a 4-lead ECG to monitor your heart rhythm </ul>\n        <ul>Check the device for lead integration and signs of lead infection</ul>\n        </ul>\n        <p>Some devices can be monitored wirelessly from your home. A small box sits next to your bed. Every night, it collects information from your device and automatically sends it back to our office to review and monitor. This includes abnormal rhythms, lead integrity issues and battery information.\n        For more information about our home monitoring program, please call our office at <a href=\"tel:+14198423000\" rel=\"tel\">419-842-3000</a>.\n        </p></div>",

This is part of ProMedica’s effort to encourage healthy eating and preventative care.</p>\n\n<p>The hoop house is made of metal framing and a heavy-duty, translucent plastic film that provides solar heating during the day and protection from the elements. It is a clinical hoop house and is the second in Michigan. The hoop house features raised garden beds at various heights for children and people in wheelchairs, as well as railings and staircases for physical therapy.

By empowering the community to support local producers, the project establishes a source of healthy, farm-to-fork, food retail outlets in food deserts and low-income areas.</p>\n\n\n<p>In 2014, the program took another step toward reducing food insecurity; a SNAP machine was obtained to extend SNAP recipients' purchasing power and provider further access to fresh fruits and vegetables for low-income residents of Lenawee County. In 2017, the Veggie Mobile began supporting Tecumseh students through the Back Pack Buddies program, which allows 120 students to receive fruit and snacks to supplement meals on weekends.</p>\n\n<p><a class=\"btn btn-primary\" href=\"/assets/documents/veggie_mobile_schedule.pdf\" title=\"Opens in a New Tab or Window\" target=\"_blank\"> View the Veggie Mobile Schedule <i class=\"fas fa-download\"></i></a></p></div>\n\n\n\n<style> .ih-location-info-box .ih-location-phone{ display :none} </style></div>",

Our team of registered nurses provide monthly education and ongoing learning opportunities that are individualized to meet each patient’s needs. Our team works directly with social workers and care navigators at local hospitals to ensure patient safety and provide quality transitions of care following hospitalizations.  </p>\n\nThe center complies with all regulatory standards and is accredited by Joint Commission and Ohio Department of Health.

Hayes (a Fremont resident), pledged $50,000 of her money, as well as her home, toward the construction of ProMedica Memorial Hospital. This gift, however, could only be realized provided the citizens of Fremont raise an additional $75,000 for the hospital.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>The matter rested until 1915 when members of the community went into action. Over the course of six days in October of that year, a whirlwind fundraising campaign known as “Fremont Never Fails” took place. The campaign resulted in $99,672 raised in addition to Mary Miller Hayes' initial $50,000 endowment.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Construction of Memorial Hospital began on August 14, 1916 on land donated by Mary Miller Hayes and her husband, Col. Webb C. Hayes, second son of President Rutherford B. Hayes. The hospital opened its doors on October 4, 1918.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Today, ProMedica Memorial Hospital is a 43 licensed-bed hospital that continues to offer comprehensive, compassionate medical care to the communities we serve.</p></div>",

It leads to better health outcomes, wiser use of resources, and greater patient and family satisfaction.</p> \n<p>As patient-and-family-centered caregivers, we recognize the vital role that families play in the health and well-being of infants, children, adolescents, and family members of all ages. We understand emotional, social, and developmental support is so important in your child’s journey to wellness.</p> \n<h4>Principles of Patient-and-Family-Centered Care</h4> \n<ul> \n\t<li><strong> Dignity and respect. </strong> We listen to and honor your family’s perspectives and choices. Your knowledge, values, beliefs, and cultural background are all considered in the planning and delivery of care for your child.</li> \n\t<li><strong> Information sharing. </strong> We communicate and share complete and unbiased information with you in ways that honor you and your child and are useful to you. You’ll receive timely, complete, and accurate information so you can participate in care and decision-making.</li> \n\t<li><strong> Participation. </strong> We support and encourage you and your family as you participate in care and decision-making at the level you choose.</li> \n\t<li><strong> Collaboration. </strong> Patients, families, health care practitioners, and hospital leaders collaborate in policy and program development, implementation and evaluation, health care facility designs, and professional education, as well as in the delivery of care.</li> \n</ul> \n<p>For more information, please call <a href=\"tel:419-291-1563\">419-291-1563</a> or e-mail <a href=\"email:Christie.Maas@ProMedica.org\">Christie.Maas@ProMedica.org.</a></p>--------------------->",

The center is home to the Autism Early Learning Program, as well as Avenues for Autism and iTaalk. The University of Toledo Occupational Therapy Department supports open play sessions in our indoor and outdoor play/sensory areas.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<h2>Autism Early Learning Program </h2>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>When your child is diagnosed with <a href=\"/services-and-conditions/autism\">autism spectrum disorder</a>, you want solutions and services that address their unique needs. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Located in the ProMedica Finnegan Family Autism Center, the Autism Early Learning Program offers early intensive behavioral intervention services for children with autism utilizing Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA). The program operates year-around with options for full day and partial day services from the age of diagnosis through 6 years. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Each child’s program is individualized with intervention focusing on building skills in the following areas: communication, behavior, play, socialization, adaptive, and developmentally appropriate skills acquisition. Services are implemented in classroom or therapy settings with 1:1 ratios and options for group learning as appropriate. Dependent on a child’s skills and needs, group learning settings with a behavior analytic approach are also available. Parent training and participation are integral to every child’s success and are mandatory across all programs.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Services at the Autism Early Learning Program are provided by board certified behavior analysts (BCBA) and center-based behavior technicians. Additional therapy services such as speech and language therapy can also be accessed at the center. All services are provided in accordance with Ohio licensure laws.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<h3>Enrolling in the Autism Early Learning Program</h3> \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>If you think your child would benefit from the Autism Early Learning Program, our staff can assess your child’s unique needs to determine how best we can support your family.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>If we believe our program will help you, we’ll arrange an appointment with one of our team members. If we don’t think the program is a good match for your situation, we’ll recommend other options or provide referrals.\n  Call us to enroll at 419-291-7080.</p>\n\n  \n<div class=\"panel-group\" id=\"accordion\" role=\"tablist\" aria-multiselectable=\"true\">\n<div class=\"panel panel-default\">\n<div class=\"panel-heading\" role=\"tab\" id=\"heading1\">\n<h3 class=\"panel-title\"><a class=\"collapsed\" role=\"button\" data-toggle=\"collapse\" data-parent=\"#accordion\" href=\"#collapse1\" aria-expanded=\"false\" aria-controls=\"collapse1\">Parent Involvement</a></h3>\n</div>\n<div id=\"collapse1\" class=\"panel-collapse collapse\" role=\"tabpanel\" aria-labelledby=\"heading1\">\n<div class=\"panel-body\">\n  <p>Our goal is to provide the best services possible for children with autism.

It works by reinforcing appropriate behavior while decreasing or eliminating interfering behavior. Opportunities for success are built into the program and adjustments are made as children progress, helping them function better in the world.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>The goal of ABA is to go from a 1:1, highly structured teaching environment to a less structured teaching environment in a small group. Then, to go to a naturalistic, large group general education setting.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>While using the principles of ABA, we systematically teach and reinforce small, measurable and attainable units of targeted skills. Every skill (small or complex) is broken down into small steps. Each step is practiced until success is achieved.</p>\n\n\n\n</div>",

We are focused on helping people restore pain-free mobility, whether it is overcoming impairments limiting strength, balance, and flexibility, or helping provide tips and tools for improved independence with daily dressing, bathing, and eating.</p>\n<h2>Special services:</h2>\n<h3>Pelvic Health</h3>\n<p>You're not alone in this. One in three women of child-bearing age experiences chronic pelvic pain and one in five women experiences pelvic floor disorder.</p>\n<p>Pelvic health issues are common, but not normal. They aren’t just part of aging or having children. Unfortunately, many people put up with it or suffer in silence because they aren’t comfortable talking about it, even with their doctor. If you think you may have a pelvic health issue, we’re here to help.</p>\n<p>Pelvic health issues can cause a variety of symptoms in women and men. Here are some of the symptoms associated with pelvic conditions:</p>\n<ul class=\"standard-list module\">\n    <li>Severe steady or intermittent pain in the pelvic area</li>\n    <li>Pain during or after intercourse</li>\n    <li>Pain while having a bowel movement or urinating</li>\n    <li>Frequent or urgent urination</li>\n    <li>Leakage or passage of urine or feces</li>\n    <li>Constipation</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>LSVT BIG</h3>\n<p>The LSVT BIG program works with patients to improve self-care, walking and other tasks. By using the simple cuing and demonstration, patient and therapist work together to \"re-calibrate\" movement to a more normal size. </p>\n<p>Each session will include research backed LSVT BIG exercises and practice of personalized functional tasks. In only four weeks of time, patients can expect to notice BIG changes in their movement that will make everyday life easier and more enjoyable.</p>\n<h2>More Services at this Location</h2>\n<ul class=\"standard-list module\">\n    <li>Aquatic Therapy</li>\n    <li>Arthritis Aquatics Classes</li>\n    <li>Balance Reeducation</li>\n    <li>Body Mechanics &amp; Postural Reeducation</li>\n    <li>Cranial-Sacral Therapy</li>\n    <li>Cognitive Evaluations</li>\n    <li>Functional Dry Needling</li>\n    <li>Gait Analysis &amp; Retraining</li>\n    <li>Geriatric Rehabilitation</li>\n    <li>Lymphedema: Complete Decongestive Therapy</li>\n    <li>Pediatric Feeding &amp; Swallowing</li>\n    <li>Swallow Studies</li>\n    <li>Speech Rehabilitation</li>\n    <li>Stroke Rehabilitation</li>\n    <li>Vocal Cord Paralysis/Hoarseness</li>\n</ul></div>",

      "description": "<div class=\"\"><p>The Cullen Center offers outpatient pediatric behavioral health assessments, counseling and group support (no psychiatric services). We are a member of the <a href=\"https://www.nctsn.org/\" target=\"_blank\">National Child Traumatic Stress Network (NCTSN)</a>.</p>\n\n\n<p>We have a community that has the knowledge, resources, and commitment to support children, teens and their families who have experienced traumatic events. Our vision is to help them to heal and reclaim their lives. Several examples of trauma are:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\n\t<li>Physical, sexual, or psychological abuse or neglect</li>\n\n\t<li>Witnessing violence in the home, school or community</li>\n\n\t<li>Sudden or violent loss of a family member or friend</li>\n\n\t<li>Victim of crime</li>\n\n\t<li>Serious accidents or life-threatening illness</li>\n\n\t<li>Accident, fire, injury or other disaster</li>\n\n\t<li>Natural or technological disasters or terrorism</li>\n\n\t<li>Bullying/cyberbullying</li>\n\n\t<li>Military family-related stressors (e.g., deployment, parental loss or injury)</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p>Without treatment, repeated childhood exposure to traumatic events can affect the brain and nervous system and increase health-risk behaviors (e.g., smoking, eating disorders, substance use, and high-risk activities). Research shows that child trauma survivors can be more likely to have long-term health problems (e.g., diabetes and heart disease) or to die at an earlier age. Traumatic stress can also lead to increased use of health and mental health services and increased involvement with the child welfare and\njuvenile justice systems. Adult survivors of traumatic events may also have difficulty in establishing fulfilling relationships and maintaining employment.</p>\n\n\n<p>The mission of The Cullen Center is to recognize the family as an expert and develop mutually respectful and equal partnerships among trauma survivors, families and professionals. Part of our job as experts is to find the best possible tools available to help families reclaim their lives. We accomplish through evidence-based and best practice trauma-focused counseling and education. A therapy model is considered evidence-based when it has been tested and proven to improve children’s performance and reduce children’s trauma-related symptoms.</p>\n\n\n<p>Following are therapies we currently provide are:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Trauma-focused Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (TF-CBT)</li>\n\n\t<li>Child Parent Psychotherapy (CPP)</li>\n\n\t<li>Attachment, Regulation Competency therapy (ARC)</li>\n\n\t<li>Theraplay and Theraplay techniques</li>\n\n\t<li>STRONG Families therapy</li>\n\n\t<li>Cognitive Processing Therapy (CPT)</li>\n\n\t<li>Trauma-informed Parenting (TIP)</li>\n\n\t<li>Hip Hop HEALS (H3\n)</li>\n\n\t<li>Individual and family counseling</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>In addition, trauma-informed individual and family interventions such as:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Support</li>\n\n\t<li>Child and family education</li>\n\n\t<li>Crisis intervention</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Other services we provide for the community include:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Trauma-informed consultation</li>\n\n\t<li>Community education</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h4>ACCESSING OUR SERVICES</h4>\n\n<p>Our goal is to determine if our services will best meet your child’s needs. Please contact our office at 419-291-7919 so we can conduct a brief phone screening to determine appropriateness.</p>\n\n\n<p>If services is deemed suitable, then we will then make an appointment for you to attend a new client orientation to complete initial paperwork and to learn about The Cullen Center and trauma-focused therapy. Following the orientation, we will schedule your child for a diagnostic assessment. While we may have suggestions for which therapist we think may be a good fit for your child, we do appreciate your input.</p>\n\n\n<p>Begin to heal. Your child, with the support of our experts, treatment, information and you, can reclaim childhood and continue growing toward a healthy life.</p></div>",
