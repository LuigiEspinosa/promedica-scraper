      "description": "<div class=\"\"><p>The Cullen Center offers outpatient pediatric behavioral health assessments, counseling and group support (no psychiatric services). We are a member of the <a href=\"https://www.nctsn.org/\" target=\"_blank\">National Child Traumatic Stress Network (NCTSN)</a>.</p>\n\n\n<p>We have a community that has the knowledge, resources, and commitment to support children, teens and their families who have experienced traumatic events. Our vision is to help them to heal and reclaim their lives. Several examples of trauma are:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\n\t<li>Physical, sexual, or psychological abuse or neglect</li>\n\n\t<li>Witnessing violence in the home, school or community</li>\n\n\t<li>Sudden or violent loss of a family member or friend</li>\n\n\t<li>Victim of crime</li>\n\n\t<li>Serious accidents or life-threatening illness</li>\n\n\t<li>Accident, fire, injury or other disaster</li>\n\n\t<li>Natural or technological disasters or terrorism</li>\n\n\t<li>Bullying/cyberbullying</li>\n\n\t<li>Military family-related stressors (e.g., deployment, parental loss or injury)</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p>Without treatment, repeated childhood exposure to traumatic events can affect the brain and nervous system and increase health-risk behaviors (e.g., smoking, eating disorders, substance use, and high-risk activities). Research shows that child trauma survivors can be more likely to have long-term health problems (e.g., diabetes and heart disease) or to die at an earlier age. Traumatic stress can also lead to increased use of health and mental health services and increased involvement with the child welfare and\njuvenile justice systems. Adult survivors of traumatic events may also have difficulty in establishing fulfilling relationships and maintaining employment.</p>\n\n\n<p>The mission of The Cullen Center is to recognize the family as an expert and develop mutually respectful and equal partnerships among trauma survivors, families and professionals. Part of our job as experts is to find the best possible tools available to help families reclaim their lives. We accomplish through evidence-based and best practice trauma-focused counseling and education. A therapy model is considered evidence-based when it has been tested and proven to improve children’s performance and reduce children’s trauma-related symptoms.</p>\n\n\n<p>Following are therapies we currently provide are:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Trauma-focused Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (TF-CBT)</li>\n\n\t<li>Child Parent Psychotherapy (CPP)</li>\n\n\t<li>Attachment, Regulation Competency therapy (ARC)</li>\n\n\t<li>Theraplay and Theraplay techniques</li>\n\n\t<li>STRONG Families therapy</li>\n\n\t<li>Cognitive Processing Therapy (CPT)</li>\n\n\t<li>Trauma-informed Parenting (TIP)</li>\n\n\t<li>Hip Hop HEALS (H3\n)</li>\n\n\t<li>Individual and family counseling</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>In addition, trauma-informed individual and family interventions such as:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Support</li>\n\n\t<li>Child and family education</li>\n\n\t<li>Crisis intervention</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Other services we provide for the community include:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Trauma-informed consultation</li>\n\n\t<li>Community education</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h4>ACCESSING OUR SERVICES</h4>\n\n<p>Our goal is to determine if our services will best meet your child’s needs. Please contact our office at 419-291-7919 so we can conduct a brief phone screening to determine appropriateness.</p>\n\n\n<p>If services is deemed suitable, then we will then make an appointment for you to attend a new client orientation to complete initial paperwork and to learn about The Cullen Center and trauma-focused therapy. Following the orientation, we will schedule your child for a diagnostic assessment. While we may have suggestions for which therapist we think may be a good fit for your child, we do appreciate your input.</p>\n\n\n<p>Begin to heal. Your child, with the support of our experts, treatment, information and you, can reclaim childhood and continue growing toward a healthy life.</p></div>",

This Registry tracks patient outcomes, enabling informed decision making about quality improvement and standardized care for patients with CF.</p> \n\n\n<p>Our long-established program has also received Quality Improvement Awards from the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation for sustaining quality improvement work that has led to better health outcomes for people with cystic fibrosis. </p>\n\n\n<p>In 2006, a robust clinical research program was developed within our Cystic Fibrosis Care Center, in conjunction with the Cystic Fibrosis Therapeutics Development Network (TDN). The TDN was created by the CF Foundation and is one of the largest CF clinical networks in the world, bringing together experts from across the country to evaluate the safety and efficacy of new CF therapies. Our center is currently enrolling patients in research studies aimed at developing new gene-targeted therapies to correct the basic defect that causes cystic fibrosis. By working in collaboration with the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation and industry sponsors, we hope to one-day find a cure for CF.</p>\n<hr>\n<h4>Contact </h4>\n<p><strong>Lead Research Coordinator:</strong> Kelly Hoot, RN, BSN - <a href=\"mailto:Kelly.hoot@promedica.org\">Kelly.hoot@promedica.org</a><br> \n<strong>Adult Coordinator:</strong> Amanda Schreiner RN, BSN - <a href=\"mailto:Amanda.schreiner@promedica.org\">Amanda.schreiner@promedica.org</a><br> \n<strong>Pediatric Coordinator:</strong> Tyger Adoure-Zehaim RN, BSN - <a href=\"mailto:Tyger.Adoure-Zehaim@promedica.org \">Tyger.Adoure-Zehaim@promedica.org</a></p> \n</div>",

We serve patients from the 21-county geographic regions of northwest Ohio and southeast Michigan. Although we are a pediatric office, our Cystic Fibrosis Center provides care for pediatric and adult patients. We use a multi-disciplinary approach to meet all of your cystic fibrosis related care needs. Our care team consists of pediatric and adult physicians, nurse coordinators, social workers, dieticians, respiratory therapists and research coordinators. To provide you with the best patient outcomes, our CF Center participates in the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation Patient Registry. This Registry tracks patient outcomes, enabling informed decision making about quality improvement and standardized care for patients with CF.</p> \n\n\n<p>Our long-established program has also received Quality Improvement Awards from the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation for sustaining quality improvement work that has led to better health outcomes for people with cystic fibrosis. </p>\n\n\n<p>In 2006, a robust clinical research program was developed within our Cystic Fibrosis Care Center, in conjunction with the Cystic Fibrosis Therapeutics Development Network (TDN). The TDN was created by the CF Foundation and is one of the largest CF clinical networks in the world, bringing together experts from across the country to evaluate the safety and efficacy of new CF therapies. Our center is currently enrolling patients in research studies aimed at developing new gene-targeted therapies to correct the basic defect that causes cystic fibrosis. By working in collaboration with the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation and industry sponsors, we hope to one-day find a cure for CF.</p>\n<hr>\n<h4>Contact </h4>\n<p><strong>Lead Research Coordinator:</strong> Kelly Hoot, RN, BSN - <a href=\"mailto:Kelly.hoot@promedica.org\">Kelly.hoot@promedica.org</a><br> \n<strong>Adult Coordinator:</strong> Amanda Schreiner RN, BSN - <a href=\"mailto:Amanda.schreiner@promedica.org\">Amanda.schreiner@promedica.org</a><br> \n<strong>Pediatric Coordinator:</strong> Tyger Adoure-Zehaim RN, BSN - <a href=\"mailto:Tyger.Adoure-Zehaim@promedica.org \">Tyger.Adoure-Zehaim@promedica.org</a></p> \n</div>",

We serve patients from the 21-county geographic regions of northwest Ohio and southeast Michigan. Although we are a pediatric office, our Cystic Fibrosis Center provides care for pediatric and adult patients. We use a multi-disciplinary approach to meet all of your cystic fibrosis related care needs. Our care team consists of pediatric and adult physicians, nurse coordinators, social workers, dieticians, respiratory therapists and research coordinators. To provide you with the best patient outcomes, our CF Center participates in the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation Patient Registry. This Registry tracks patient outcomes, enabling informed decision making about quality improvement and standardized care for patients with CF.</p> \n\n\n<p>Our long-established program has also received Quality Improvement Awards from the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation for sustaining quality improvement work that has led to better health outcomes for people with cystic fibrosis. </p>\n\n\n<p>In 2006, a robust clinical research program was developed within our Cystic Fibrosis Care Center, in conjunction with the Cystic Fibrosis Therapeutics Development Network (TDN). The TDN was created by the CF Foundation and is one of the largest CF clinical networks in the world, bringing together experts from across the country to evaluate the safety and efficacy of new CF therapies. Our center is currently enrolling patients in research studies aimed at developing new gene-targeted therapies to correct the basic defect that causes cystic fibrosis. By working in collaboration with the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation and industry sponsors, we hope to one-day find a cure for CF.</p>\n<hr>\n<h4>Contact </h4>\n<p><strong>Lead Research Coordinator:</strong> Kelly Hoot, RN, BSN - <a href=\"mailto:Kelly.hoot@promedica.org\">Kelly.hoot@promedica.org</a><br> \n<strong>Adult Coordinator:</strong> Amanda Schreiner RN, BSN - <a href=\"mailto:Amanda.schreiner@promedica.org\">Amanda.schreiner@promedica.org</a><br> \n<strong>Pediatric Coordinator:</strong> Tyger Adoure-Zehaim RN, BSN - <a href=\"mailto:Tyger.Adoure-Zehaim@promedica.org \">Tyger.Adoure-Zehaim@promedica.org</a></p> \n</div>",

These exams help our physicians diagnose and treat a variety of conditions, including ulcers, intestinal bleeding, tumors, and polyps.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>The ProMedica Endoscopy Center is affiliated with ProMedica Toledo Hospital, which is accredited by The Joint Commission. It is handicap accessible with sufficient parking and a comfortable family waiting room.</div></div>",

Services are implemented in classroom or therapy settings with 1:1 ratios and options for group learning as appropriate. Dependent on a child’s skills and needs, group learning settings with a behavior analytic approach are also available. Parent training and participation are integral to every child’s success and are mandatory across all programs.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Services at the Autism Early Learning Program are provided by board certified behavior analysts (BCBA) and center-based behavior technicians.

Services are implemented in classroom or therapy settings with 1:1 ratios and options for group learning as appropriate. Dependent on a child’s skills and needs, group learning settings with a behavior analytic approach are also available. Parent training and participation are integral to every child’s success and are mandatory across all programs.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Services at the Autism Early Learning Program are provided by board certified behavior analysts (BCBA) and center-based behavior technicians.

Opportunities for success are built into the program and adjustments are made as children progress, helping them function better in the world.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>The goal of ABA is to go from a 1:1, highly structured teaching environment to a less structured teaching environment in a small group. Then, to go to a naturalistic, large group general education setting.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>While using the principles of ABA, we systematically teach and reinforce small, measurable and attainable units of targeted skills. Every skill (small or complex) is broken down into small steps. Each step is practiced until success is achieved.</p>\n\n\n\n</div>",

The program operates year-around with options for full day and partial day services from the age of diagnosis through 6 years. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Each child’s program is individualized with intervention focusing on building skills in the following areas: communication, behavior, play, socialization, adaptive, and developmentally appropriate skills acquisition. Services are implemented in classroom or therapy settings with 1:1 ratios and options for group learning as appropriate. Dependent on a child’s skills and needs, group learning settings with a behavior analytic approach are also available. Parent training and participation are integral to every child’s success and are mandatory across all programs.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Services at the Autism Early Learning Program are provided by board certified behavior analysts (BCBA) and center-based behavior technicians. Additional therapy services such as speech and language therapy can also be accessed at the center. All services are provided in accordance with Ohio licensure laws.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<h3>Enrolling in the Autism Early Learning Program</h3> \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>If you think your child would benefit from the Autism Early Learning Program, our staff can assess your child’s unique needs to determine how best we can support your family.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>If we believe our program will help you, we’ll arrange an appointment with one of our team members.

It works by reinforcing appropriate behavior while decreasing or eliminating interfering behavior. Opportunities for success are built into the program and adjustments are made as children progress, helping them function better in the world.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>The goal of ABA is to go from a 1:1, highly structured teaching environment to a less structured teaching environment in a small group. Then, to go to a naturalistic, large group general education setting.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>While using the principles of ABA, we systematically teach and reinforce small, measurable and attainable units of targeted skills. Every skill (small or complex) is broken down into small steps. Each step is practiced until success is achieved.</p>\n\n\n\n</div>",

Services are implemented in classroom or therapy settings with 1:1 ratios and options for group learning as appropriate. Dependent on a child’s skills and needs, group learning settings with a behavior analytic approach are also available. Parent training and participation are integral to every child’s success and are mandatory across all programs.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Services at the Autism Early Learning Program are provided by board certified behavior analysts (BCBA) and center-based behavior technicians.
