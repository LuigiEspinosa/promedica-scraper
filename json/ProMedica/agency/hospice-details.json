While honoring the patients, it is not unusual to see many of the staff in tears. This shows their compassion for the patients and their own grief at the passing of people for whom they so lovingly cared for.</p>\n<p>The most moving part of the ceremony is the rose offering. Each patient who has passed away is memorialized with a long-stemmed white rose tagged with his or her name.&nbsp; As attendees arrive, they are each asked to take a white rose. During the program, the names of the deceased are read out loud and the person who has the white rose for that individual comes to the podium and places the rose in a vase.</p>\n<p>Over the year, many of the patients being remembered have been cared for by Heartland Hospice. This year, Heartland chose to sponsor the entire event as a way of recognizing not only the patients, but their caregivers as well. In recognition of Heartland’s sponsorship, the staff gifted the team a beautiful plaque for the office lobby.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Heartland Hospice was truly honored to be a part of this event.</p>\n\n\n                </div>\n            </div>        </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n    <div>\n        <div class=\"container\">\n        <div class=\"row clearfix\">\n            <div class=\"span12 col\">\n                <div style=\"width: 100%;\">\n                            \n    \n    <img src=\"/media/8843/plaque-2.jpg\" class=\"responsiveImg\">\n\n\n                </div>\n            </div>        </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n                </div>\n    </div>\n\n\n\t                  <a class=\"close-icon popup_heartlan2_close\">\n\t                    <img src=\"/css/images/x-close-navy.svg\" alt=\"close-icon\">\n\t                </a>\n\t            "

I was becoming very discouraged because of how difficult it was to communicate with her.</em></p>\n<p><em>Music had always been important in our life, so when Heartland Hospice offered music therapy, I gladly accepted it. I was thrilled when Laura invited me to sing along with her. Although I was only able to join via video due to restrictions, I could see Mom’s face light up when she saw me and heard me sing. I am passionate about singing and have had the pleasure of performing locally and on a friend’s CD and Mom has always been my biggest fan.</em></p>\n<p><em>Our singing sessions mean so much to me, and I can see by the look in Mom’s eyes that they mean a lot to her too. At times I even see her mouthing along to the words of the songs, moving her head to the rhythm and tapping her fingers to the beat. Music therapy has given me back a part of my Mom I thought I had lost.</em></p>\n<p><em>It’s a wonderful thing to see Mom smiling and laughing and know that I am the reason. Where words fail, music speaks. Thank you, Laura and Heartland Hospice.” &nbsp;</em></p>\n<p>-Christine Merwarth, daughter</p>\n\n\n                </div>\n            </div>        </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n                </div>\n    </div>\n\n\n\t                  <a class=\"close-icon popup_musicthe1_close\">\n\t                    <img src=\"/css/images/x-close-navy.svg\" alt=\"close-icon\">\n\t                </a>\n\t            "

Didi Caramuche, Manager of Business Development, details the fun and encouraging event:</p>\n<p>“Account Liaisons, Aleks Szerling and Jen Hallman, along with Care Transition Coordinator, Amanda Klauder, each painted inspirational and uplifting sayings on large rocks and strategically placed them on the grounds of skilled nursing facilities and hospitals throughout the Lehigh Valley area.&nbsp;Initially, an email was sent to those facilities and hospitals that permitted the placement of the rocks. The email read: ‘You are all ROCKstars! Just in case anyone needed a reminder: you are OUR rock and we THANK YOU for all that you do every day! We have decided to start a rock challenge! With everything going on, a simple message or picture can be enough to provide encouragement and brighten someone’s day.&nbsp;A positive message at the right time can shift the way of thinking in someone’s entire day.&nbsp;Together we can all make the world a kinder place. Somewhere on your facility grounds, a kindness rock has been placed. If you find the rock, please give us a call. CONGRATULATIONS and thank you for all you do! We encourage you all to add to the collection to spread kindness and smiles!’</p>\n<p>The response has been phenomenal! Administrator of ManorCare Health Services - Easton, Melissa King, stated, ‘I love this idea!’ Jessica Redington and Jennifer Skriletz, both from the business office of ManorCare Health Services – West Allen were delighted to find two rocks on their property.&nbsp;Jennifer said, ‘That was such a fun idea! The rock is so pretty; I want to keep it in our office.’ Lydia, Social Worker from ManorCare Health Services – Allentown loved the idea so much that she is planning on speaking with the activities director to incorporate rock painting with residents to add to our rock garden.&nbsp;Dwayne, maintenance director, was pleased to spot the rock while doing his work around the grounds and was happy with the encouragement that it brought.</p>\n<p>Our goal is to be supportive to all the people braving the frontlines during this difficult time. We wanted to brighten up their world a little just like the way they bring cheer to others.&nbsp;I had a feeling that this would make people feel good, but I don’t think any of us thought it would become what it has.&nbsp;We hope the cheer and encouragement is contagious.”</p>\n\n\n                </div>\n            </div>        </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n    <div>\n        <div class=\"container\">\n        <div class=\"row clearfix\">\n            <div class=\"span6 col\">\n                <div style=\"width: 100%;\">\n                            \n    \n    <img src=\"/media/9312/allentown-heartland-hospice_rock-pictures_page_2.jpg\" class=\"responsiveImg\">\n\n\n                </div>\n            </div>            <div class=\"span6 col\">\n                <div style=\"width: 100%;\">\n                            \n    \n    <img src=\"/media/9313/allentown-heartland-hospice_rock-pictures_page_3.jpg\" class=\"responsiveImg\">\n\n\n                </div>\n            </div>        </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n    <div>\n        <div class=\"container\">\n        <div class=\"row clearfix\">\n            <div class=\"span4 col\">\n                <div style=\"width: 100%;\">\n                            \n    \n    <img src=\"/media/9314/allentown-heartland-hospice_rock-pictures_page_4.jpg\" class=\"responsiveImg\">\n\n\n                </div>\n            </div>            <div class=\"span4 col\">\n                <div style=\"width: 100%;\">\n                            \n    \n    <img src=\"/media/9311/allentown-heartland-hospice_rock-pictures_page_1.jpg\" class=\"responsiveImg\">\n\n\n                </div>\n            </div>            <div class=\"span4 col\">\n                <div style=\"width: 100%;\">\n                            \n    \n    <img src=\"/media/9315/allentown-heartland-hospice_rock-pictures_page_5.jpg\" class=\"responsiveImg\">\n\n\n                </div>\n            </div>        </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n    <div>\n        <div class=\"container\">\n        <div class=\"row clearfix\">\n            <div class=\"span12 col\">\n                <div style=\"width: 100%;\">\n                            \n    \n    <img src=\"/media/9316/rocks-team-original-size.jpg\" class=\"responsiveImg\">\n\n\n                </div>\n            </div>        </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n                </div>\n    </div>\n\n\n\t                  <a class=\"close-icon popup_heartlan2_close\">\n\t                    <img src=\"/css/images/x-close-navy.svg\" alt=\"close-icon\">\n\t                </a>\n\t            "

Our RN was Heather during the day and Dawn at night. They each were amazing women. First with Heather, she absolutely came in compassionate, understanding, and open to all ideas and ways. She gave us the tools and teaching that we needed to take on the care of my mother-in-law. We had them for only 11 days but they impacted our family. She came out or called any time we needed her and never once did I seem to think we were a bother. Heather even would take the time out to call and make sure we were alright and my mother-in-law was doing fine.</p>\n<p>After my mother-in-law had passed, she had come to sit with me for a bit. I didn't deserve such kindness but I got it anyway. She listened to me, laughed with me, and let me cry. She also comforted me. She went over and beyond her job and I am forever grateful to her.</p>\n<p>Dawn was on-call at night and she had run out to the house a few times to either give us supplies or if we had any concerns she was there. She always had been so kind and sweet. She was there to take care of my mother-in-law once she had passed and did such a great job and was very respectful to us as a family. She was able to guide us on what we were able to do and let us take our time with my mother- in-law. We never seemed rushed or pushed. She went well beyond her job duties.</p>\n<p>Sarah was the massage therapist, thank you for her massage. My mother-in-law was so happy that day. Jennifer who was the aide for my mother-in-law was amazing. She is a very friendly, outgoing, funny girl. She let us help bath my mother-in-law and asked a lot of questions. She was very respectful and sweet. She always went over her job for us. To all those women, Thank You!!!! Her last days were filled with love, caring, and most important peace. It was exhausting, sad, with some laughs in between and you guys made the difficult situation smoother. I am forever grateful for the kindness you all showed us. God bless you all.\"</p>\n<p>-Review on Caring.com for Heartland Hospice serving Ann Arbor</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n                </div>\n            </div>        </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n                </div>\n    </div>\n\n\n\t                  <a class=\"close-icon popup_heartlan1_close\">\n\t                    <img src=\"/css/images/x-close-navy.svg\" alt=\"close-icon\">\n\t                </a>\n\t            "

There were veterans present who served in a variety of branches of the armed services and wars including: World War II, the Korean War and Vietnam.</p>\n<p>“I wanted to share my experiences that I had at my first Veterans Celebration,” said Kristi Reed, Heartland Hospice Account Liaison. She added, “I was honored to pin 50 veterans that came into the Putnam Senior Center for their annual celebration. The veterans shared&nbsp;so many unforgettable stories both happy and sad. In fact, I overhead one veteran say he was in the Vietnam War when his platoon of twenty-three soldiers came under attack and seventeen of the servicemen lost their lives. This veteran advised that he was number eighteen but later they found him alive. His family had been notified of his death the day before they found him. That phone call home was one to never be forgotten. Now, this veteran has started a fund for grave blankets for our service men and women so no one is left behind,” added Kristi.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;“While pinning our veterans, we had so many that came to tears, some even told us they had never been told&nbsp;'Thank You'&nbsp;for their services until now. This shows them that we care for them as people and what they have done for our country will never be forgotten,” explained Kristi.</p>\n<p>Celebrated on November 11<sup>th</sup> every year, Veterans Day provides an opportunity to focus attention on celebrating and honoring America’s Veterans for their patriotism, love of country and willingness to serve and sacrifice for the common good. Heartland is dedicated to serving those who have served our country.</p>\n<p>(Pictured above: Veteran, Victor Nester, proudly shows the certificate of appreciation that he received from Kristi Reed during the pinning ceremony.)</p>\n\n\n                </div>\n            </div>        </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n                </div>\n    </div>\n\n\n\t                  <a class=\"close-icon popup_heartlan2_close\">\n\t                    <img src=\"/css/images/x-close-navy.svg\" alt=\"close-icon\">\n\t                </a>\n\t            "

She was overwhelmed and expressed how wonderful and thoughtful it was of Heartland to remember her mother and celebrate her birthday.</p>\n<p>When Ashanti, who has been providing care for Mary for over a year, asked her how old she was, her response was, “I don’t think about it, I think I am 100+!”</p>\n<p>Mary served as an evangelist, loves to sing gospel hymns and shared how glad she is that the Lord let her live to see another birthday. Heartland had a wonderful time helping Mary celebrate such a milestone.</p>\n\n\n                </div>\n            </div>        </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n    <div>\n        <div class=\"container\">\n        <div class=\"row clearfix\">\n            <div class=\"span6 col\">\n                <div style=\"width: 100%;\">\n                            \n    \n    <img src=\"/media/9243/m-tinlsey-bday-2.jpg\" class=\"responsiveImg\">\n\n\n                </div>\n            </div>            <div class=\"span6 col\">\n                <div style=\"width: 100%;\">\n                            \n    \n    <img src=\"/media/9244/m-tinsley-bday.jpg\" class=\"responsiveImg\">\n\n\n                </div>\n            </div>        </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n                </div>\n    </div>\n\n\n\t                  <a class=\"close-icon popup_heartlan2_close\">\n\t                    <img src=\"/css/images/x-close-navy.svg\" alt=\"close-icon\">\n\t                </a>\n\t            "

Yet, within the context of inviting U.S. Veterans from the Vietnam War to reflect authentically upon their service, this quick-witted reply captures both the grit of surviving the war and its elongated aftermath in the decades that have followed it.</p>\n<p>Gordon Creamer, Heartland Hospice volunteer coordinator and chairperson for Heartland’s We Honor Veterans Committees in Maryland, details the importance of not only recognizing veterans, but also taking time to listen to their stories and truly understanding what their service means to each of them.</p>\n<p>“Virtual events are a piece of the storytelling ingredient Heartland Hospice utilizes to affirm and heal service women and men who have struggled with countless and varied traumas endured during their tenure in the military and thereafter. Recently, the We Honor Veterans Committees of the Heartland Hospice agencies in Maryland facilitated virtual events to affirm and celebrate veterans of the Vietnam War era and their loved ones. With the inclusion of both an educational resource panel and honor ceremony, Heartland staff and volunteers provided members of the veteran community with a meaningful and uplifting occasion to gather in solidarity to tell their respective stories and to be recognized for their forgotten sacrifices, losses and survival.</p>\n<p>As Level Five partners, the highest level of partnership within the We Honor Veterans program, the Heartland agencies are required to host an event that “welcomes home” service members who originally were cruelly rejected, maligned and discriminated against because they fought in the Vietnam War. Heartland uniquely embraced these occasions and its participants by forgoing cancellation due to the COVID-19 pandemic and instead facilitating not one, but two, special festivities virtually. Additionally, the components of the panel and ceremony passionately recognized and validated the mixed experiences of the American citizens who served in this war.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Individuals from local communities, Charlotte Hall Veterans Home and several care facilities actively participated in both virtual events. Each attendee received an appreciation package a few days in advance, personally and safely delivered by a Heartland Veteran Volunteer or staff member. These packages included a customized Vietnam Veterans hat, a “Star” from Stars for Our Troops, a Heartland Salute medal, a personalized framed certificate of honor, a “Courage Box”, resource materials and a program folder.</p>\n<p>With the centerpiece of each program being the storytelling portion, several personal and stirring tales were revealed by veterans as they reflected on tragedies endured and lessons learned. The incorporation of live music and poetry, an opening blessing, a closing moment of silence and a period of applause and cheering for each veteran further fulfilled the overarching mission of not erasing the first time these women and men returned home from the war, but rather reimagined it with long overdue appreciation and esteemed respect.</p>\n<p>In the face of the ongoing pandemic, this entire experience has created some substantial takeaways as our We Honor Veterans Committees continue their steadfast pledge of support to those who have served our country. In particular, the intention to truly pause and listen with reverence when a veteran shares his or her story has become paramount, second only to gazing first upon that veteran with admiration and asking a simple question or two about what their service means to them.”</p>\n\n\n                </div>\n            </div>        </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n                </div>\n    </div>\n\n\n\t                  <a class=\"close-icon popup_heartlan1_close\">\n\t                    <img src=\"/css/images/x-close-navy.svg\" alt=\"close-icon\">\n\t                </a>\n\t            "

Level Five is the highest level We Honor Veterans partners can attain and includes several new required activities and yearly recertification.</p>\n<p>All wars are different and provide unique experiences and often difficulties for the Veterans who served in them. We Honor Veterans was launched by the National Hospice and Palliative Care Organization in collaboration with the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to help improve the care veterans receive from hospice and palliative care providers.</p>\n<p>\"As a veteran, I am gratified to work with an organization who so highly values those who served and sacrificed in the United States military. Achieving Level Five partnership was certainly a challenge on top of our normal duties, but also a labor of love in order to show our veterans and their families how much we honor and cherish them,” said Gordon Fox, Heartland Hospice Chaplain and retired U.S. Navy Commander.</p>\n<p>The We Honor Veterans program provides five levels of recognition to organizations that demonstrate a commitment to improving care for veterans. Aside from existing partner requirements, Level Five partners place a greater emphasis on staff education and caring for Vietnam-era and combat Veterans. Additionally, Level Five partners take on the role of regional mentor to other We Honor Veterans partners working to enhance their programs.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“When we set out to create the Level Five program we knew that it had to be different to truly showcase the efforts needed to go above and beyond. Not only has the Heartland Hospice team demonstrated their commitment, but they have helped shape the program and have continued as an example of what all hospice partners should strive to be,” said NHPCO President &amp; CEO Edo Banach.</p>\n<p>To learn more about the We Honor Veterans initiative, the steps that our agencies have taken to receive this acknowledgement or to see where other Heartland agencies are at in the process of achieving this honor, visit the <a rel=\"noopener\" href=\"http://www.wehonorveterans.org\" target=\"_blank\">We Honor Veterans website</a>.</p>\n\n\n                </div>\n            </div>        </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n                </div>\n    </div>\n\n\n\t                  <a class=\"close-icon popup_heartlan2_close\">\n\t                    <img src=\"/css/images/x-close-navy.svg\" alt=\"close-icon\">\n\t                </a>\n\t            "

Earl’s nephew and caregiver, Gerry, who also served our country during the Vietnam War, was present for the Recognition Ceremony of his uncle. Earl served in the U.S. Army during the Korean War, or now referred to as the Korean “Conflict”. Earl revealed that he had never received full acknowledgment for his commitment to the U.S. Military because the events of the Korean Conflict were not considered to be a war and therefore he was not regarded as an Army Veteran. He welled up with tears while sharing his experiences during his years of service in the early 1950’s. Upon learning that the Korean War is referred to as the Korean Conflict, it created a poignant moment during Heartland’s recognition ceremony to honor Earl.</p>\n\n\n                </div>\n            </div>        </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n    <div>\n        <div class=\"container\">\n        <div class=\"row clearfix\">\n            <div class=\"span4 col\">\n                <div style=\"width: 100%;\">\n                            \n    \n    <img src=\"/media/8731/bell-and-nephew-gerry.jpg\" class=\"responsiveImg\">\n\n\n                </div>\n            </div>            <div class=\"span4 col\">\n                <div style=\"width: 100%;\">\n                            \n    \n    <img src=\"/media/8729/bell-and-team-pic.jpg\" class=\"responsiveImg\">\n\n\n                </div>\n            </div>            <div class=\"span4 col\">\n                <div style=\"width: 100%;\">\n                            \n    \n    <img src=\"/media/8732/mel-and-bell.jpg\" class=\"responsiveImg\">\n\n\n                </div>\n            </div>        </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n    <div>\n        <div class=\"container\">\n        <div class=\"row clearfix\">\n            <div class=\"span12 col\">\n                <div style=\"width: 100%;\">\n                            \n    \n<h5>&nbsp;</h5>\n<h5>Cecil Baker</h5>\n<p>The Heartland team visited with Cecil Baker who was surrounded by his daughter, family members and friends from his years of living in the Baltimore area for his Veteran Recognition Ceremony.

Kate Milko Coulter, a retired U.S. Air Force Veteran and Heartland Hospice Volunteer, proudly presented Cecil with his Heartland certificate of appreciation.</p>\n\n\n                </div>\n            </div>        </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n    <div>\n        <div class=\"container\">\n        <div class=\"row clearfix\">\n            <div class=\"span4 col\">\n                <div style=\"width: 100%;\">\n                            \n    \n    <img src=\"/media/8733/5.jpg\" class=\"responsiveImg\">\n\n\n                </div>\n            </div>            <div class=\"span4 col\">\n                <div style=\"width: 100%;\">\n                            \n    \n    <img src=\"/media/8730/10.jpg\" class=\"responsiveImg\">\n\n\n                </div>\n            </div>            <div class=\"span4 col\">\n                <div style=\"width: 100%;\">\n                            \n    \n    <img src=\"/media/8734/11.jpg\" class=\"responsiveImg\">\n\n\n                </div>\n            </div>        </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n                </div>\n    </div>\n\n\n\t                  <a class=\"close-icon popup_heartlan4_close\">\n\t                    <img src=\"/css/images/x-close-navy.svg\" alt=\"close-icon\">\n\t                </a>\n\t            "

The camp helps with addressing the grieving process with communal support and musical intervention, which has made a significant difference for children and their families who have experienced the death of a loved one.</p>\n<p>Camp Healing Hearts offers a variety of activities, such as special arts and crafts like art journaling and musical activities. Other activities include calming bottles and memory boxes. These activities help the children cope with the anxieties associated with grief and be able to express their emotions and manage the grieving process in a safe environment. Corresponding adult grief sessions were also offered in addition to sessions for the children.</p>\n<p>Philadelphia musician, and musical percussionist, Josh Robinson made an impact to the children at Camp Healing Hearts with a “Drum it Out!” workshop with the expressed purpose of teaching an alternative coping mechanism for managing grief. Josh’s musical excursion allowed camp participants to experience the power of musical reflection, which had given them the ability to mirror their own stories through song. He has spent the last 20 years using her percussive abilities to enrich the lives of those around him.</p>\n<p>Camp Healing Hearts made an impact on the campers who were unsure of coming and opening up about the loss of their loved one. Addison, a camper, shared, “It was a lot more than what I expected. I didn’t think I would like it, but now that came I really like it.”</p>\n<p>Another camper, Harper, shared, “I thought this would be really sad and wasn’t sure I wanted to attend, but it was fun, and I want to come back.”</p>\n<p>Volunteers for Camp Healing Hearts come from local universities and the community. Volunteers act as buddies to the campers, and they help with activities and projects, such as crafting drums, and they also assist campers with creating arts and crafts.</p>\n<p>Maddy, a volunteer, stated, “Volunteering for Camp Healing Hearts has been great because I was able to experience my own sense of grief management while helping my buddies. What I was surprised about was that I don’t think I really dealt with the death of my father, so this was good for me too. My buddy and I had a great positive experience. I think that camp showed the children how to have fun while experiencing their emotions around grief.”</p>\n<p>A mother of one of the campers attended one of the adult sessions and said, “The death of a loved one is never something anybody ever thinks they will have to deal with. Then one day your whole life changes. The fact that there are resources available to us is just phenomenal. I felt safe sharing my feelings and received helpful ideas to process my feelings and those of my children. Love Camp Healing Hearts.”</p>\n<p>Thanks to the ProMedica Hospice Memorial Fund and Ascension St. Mary’s Hospital, Camp Healing Hearts is free of charge. The Children’s Grief Center of the Great Lakes Bay Region also assisted with volunteer support and activities.</p>\n\n\n                </div>\n            </div>        </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n    <div>\n        <div class=\"container\">\n        <div class=\"row clearfix\">\n            <div class=\"span6 col\">\n                <div style=\"width: 100%;\">\n                            \n    \n    <img src=\"/media/11994/img_20220924_121037bottles2.jpg\" class=\"responsiveImg\">\n\n\n                </div>\n            </div>            <div class=\"span6 col\">\n                <div style=\"width: 100%;\">\n                            \n    \n    <img src=\"/media/11993/img_20220924_105836buckets.jpg\" class=\"responsiveImg\">\n\n\n                </div>\n            </div>        </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n    <div>\n        <div class=\"container\">\n        <div class=\"row clearfix\">\n            <div class=\"span6 col\">\n                <div style=\"width: 100%;\">\n                            \n    \n    <img src=\"/media/11995/josh.jpg\" class=\"responsiveImg\">\n\n\n                </div>\n            </div>            <div class=\"span6 col\">\n                <div style=\"width: 100%;\">\n                            \n    \n    <img src=\"/media/11996/phone-screenshot-image-edit.jpg\" class=\"responsiveImg\">\n\n\n                </div>\n            </div>        </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n                </div>\n    </div>\n\n\n\t                  <a class=\"close-icon popup_promedic1_close\">\n\t                    <img src=\"/css/images/x-close-navy.svg\" alt=\"close-icon\">\n\t                </a>\n\t            "

Heartland Home Health &amp; Hospice wanted to plan a fundraiser to help their community recover from the damages so the team reached out to Melanie Maraugha, Donor Relations Manager, Grants Officer with ProMedica Foundation, to find out what they could do to for a fundraiser and she informed the agency that through the Heartland Hospice Memorial Fund and ProMedica Foundation they could donate $10,000 to their community.</p>\n<p>The Heartland Hospice Memorial Fund donation was distributed between Riverside Place of Midland, Great Lakes Bay Veterans Coalition and United Way of Midland County’s Rise Together Fund. When Heartland found out that Riverside Place of Midland had to immediately evacuate their residence due to the flooding, they felt it was important to help them with some of the donation funds. Heartland is also committed to serving Veterans in the community and is a partner with the We Honor Veterans Program. Kendall MacConnell, Veteran Volunteer, mentioned that he had volunteered with the Great Lakes Bay Veterans Coalition handing out food to those who were in need after the flood, the team knew this was an organization they also wanted to help. The Heartland team found out that the Great Lakes Bay Veterans Coalition matches their donations to help restore the homes of Veterans that were damaged by the flood. Another vital organization Heartland wanted to give to was the United Way of Midland County’s Rise Together Fund as they continue to help those affected by the flood.</p>\n<p>Representatives from the organizations attended the check presentation that was held on July 24, 2020 at the Heartland Home Health &amp; Hospice office. Brad, Terry and Greg from the Veterans Coalition attended and shared how they helped with evacuating local residents, set-up shelters and transported food to shelters. Ashley and Lindsay from the United Way of Midland County also attended the check presentation and were very thankful to Heartland for their donation. Kim with Riverside was unable to attend the check presentation but expressed her appreciation for the donation and the support from Heartland to help restore their facility where so many seniors call home.</p>\n<p>“I honestly tear up trying to put into words what it means to the Heartland team to be able to support our community. We are blessed to work within an organization that truly shares our mission of serving others and with these local organizations serving those who need help the most during this natural disaster. We are so very thankful to Melanie and the Heartland Hospice Memorial Fund for helping our agency give back to others. I feel great about working for an organization that is proven to be as they claim: Helpful, Caring and Responsive!” said Julie Rousse, Administrator.</p>\n\n\n                </div>\n            </div>        </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n    <div>\n        <div class=\"container\">\n        <div class=\"row clearfix\">\n            <div class=\"span12 col\">\n                <div style=\"width: 100%;\">\n                            \n    \n    <img src=\"/media/9570/check-presentation-7-24-2020-2.jpg\" class=\"responsiveImg\">\n\n\n                </div>\n            </div>        </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n                </div>\n    </div>\n\n\n\t                  <a class=\"close-icon popup_heartlan2_close\">\n\t                    <img src=\"/css/images/x-close-navy.svg\" alt=\"close-icon\">\n\t                </a>\n\t            "

Yet, within the context of inviting U.S. Veterans from the Vietnam War to reflect authentically upon their service, this quick-witted reply captures both the grit of surviving the war and its elongated aftermath in the decades that have followed it.</p>\n<p>Gordon Creamer, Heartland Hospice volunteer coordinator and chairperson for Heartland’s We Honor Veterans Committees in Maryland, details the importance of not only recognizing veterans, but also taking time to listen to their stories and truly understanding what their service means to each of them.</p>\n<p>“Virtual events are a piece of the storytelling ingredient Heartland Hospice utilizes to affirm and heal service women and men who have struggled with countless and varied traumas endured during their tenure in the military and thereafter. Recently, the We Honor Veterans Committees of the Heartland Hospice agencies in Maryland facilitated virtual events to affirm and celebrate veterans of the Vietnam War era and their loved ones. With the inclusion of both an educational resource panel and honor ceremony, Heartland staff and volunteers provided members of the veteran community with a meaningful and uplifting occasion to gather in solidarity to tell their respective stories and to be recognized for their forgotten sacrifices, losses and survival.</p>\n<p>As Level Five partners, the highest level of partnership within the We Honor Veterans program, the Heartland agencies are required to host an event that “welcomes home” service members who originally were cruelly rejected, maligned and discriminated against because they fought in the Vietnam War. Heartland uniquely embraced these occasions and its participants by forgoing cancellation due to the COVID-19 pandemic and instead facilitating not one, but two, special festivities virtually. Additionally, the components of the panel and ceremony passionately recognized and validated the mixed experiences of the American citizens who served in this war.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Individuals from local communities, Charlotte Hall Veterans Home and several care facilities actively participated in both virtual events. Each attendee received an appreciation package a few days in advance, personally and safely delivered by a Heartland Veteran Volunteer or staff member. These packages included a customized Vietnam Veterans hat, a “Star” from Stars for Our Troops, a Heartland Salute medal, a personalized framed certificate of honor, a “Courage Box”, resource materials and a program folder.</p>\n<p>With the centerpiece of each program being the storytelling portion, several personal and stirring tales were revealed by veterans as they reflected on tragedies endured and lessons learned. The incorporation of live music and poetry, an opening blessing, a closing moment of silence and a period of applause and cheering for each veteran further fulfilled the overarching mission of not erasing the first time these women and men returned home from the war, but rather reimagined it with long overdue appreciation and esteemed respect.</p>\n<p>In the face of the ongoing pandemic, this entire experience has created some substantial takeaways as our We Honor Veterans Committees continue their steadfast pledge of support to those who have served our country. In particular, the intention to truly pause and listen with reverence when a veteran shares his or her story has become paramount, second only to gazing first upon that veteran with admiration and asking a simple question or two about what their service means to them.”</p>\n\n\n                </div>\n            </div>        </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n                </div>\n    </div>\n\n\n\t                  <a class=\"close-icon popup_heartlan1_close\">\n\t                    <img src=\"/css/images/x-close-navy.svg\" alt=\"close-icon\">\n\t                </a>\n\t            "

Level Five is the highest level We Honor Veterans partners can attain and includes several new required activities and yearly recertification.</p>\n<p>All wars are different and provide unique experiences and often difficulties for the Veterans who served in them. We Honor Veterans was launched by the National Hospice and Palliative Care Organization in collaboration with the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to help improve the care veterans receive from hospice and palliative care providers.</p>\n<p>“We will be forever grateful for this achievement, but even more so for the opportunity to serve our veterans… our heroes!” said Beverly Dean, Heartland Hospice administrator. John Webster, Heartland Hospice team coordinator and U.S. Marine Corps Veteran added, “My experience, being a veteran myself, is that I really appreciate what our agency has done for the veterans of all eras, especially the Vietnam era. They were forgotten by people during that time and it has really showed me that we appreciate the sacrifice they made for our freedom.”</p>\n<p>“Some people don’t understand when a person enlists into the military that they are committing to the protection of our country by any means necessary. What that can mean is that we are willing to sacrifice our wellbeing to keep our country safe and that decision not only affects the enlisted person, but it also affects the family of that person, knowing that at any time they may have to make the ultimate sacrifice. Our agency has given me hope to believe that there are still some people out there who appreciate us vets. For that, I would like to say ‘Oooh Rahh!’” said Webster.</p>\n<p>The We Honor Veterans program provides five levels of recognition to organizations that demonstrate a commitment to improving care for veterans. Aside from existing partner requirements, Level Five partners place a greater emphasis on staff education and caring for Vietnam-era and combat Veterans. Additionally, Level Five partners take on the role of regional mentor to other We Honor Veterans partners working to enhance their programs.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“When we set out to create the Level Five program, we knew that it had to be different to truly showcase the efforts needed to go above and beyond. Not only has the Heartland Hospice team demonstrated their commitment, but they have helped shape the program and have continued as an example of what all hospice partners should strive to be,” said NHPCO President &amp; CEO Edo Banach.</p>\n<p>To learn more about the We Honor Veterans initiative, the steps that our agencies have taken to receive this acknowledgement or to see where other Heartland agencies are at in the process of achieving this honor, visit the <a rel=\"noopener\" href=\"http://www.wehonorveterans.org\" target=\"_blank\">We Honor Veterans website</a>.</p>\n\n\n                </div>\n            </div>        </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n                </div>\n    </div>\n\n\n\t                  <a class=\"close-icon popup_heartlan2_close\">\n\t                    <img src=\"/css/images/x-close-navy.svg\" alt=\"close-icon\">\n\t                </a>\n\t            "

Options for care, practitioners, testing, announcements, reveal parties, birthing, delivery, parental leave, and the list goes on. Notable is that our society in general does more planning for birth compared to death. The more important yet difficult choice is ... how do we want to die?</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"node-body\">\n<p>Allow me to share a story about my grandfather, a man of many lives, literally. I never thought Grandpa would die; he would live forever, right? I recall many times, Mom calling, \"You better come to the hospital, Grandpa isn't doing well, and he might not make it today.\" Only to make the visit, say \"I love you\" and \"See you next time\" to learn the next day Grandpa was home, back to his normal self, living life!</p>\n<p>This happened about 10 times in the last 12 years of his life. Never once do I recall our family having the conversation with my grandpa about his life, his goals and wishes, let alone what really matters ... when he is sick, really sick, and not able to make his own wishes known, what does he want for his life, or for that matter, his end of life?</p>\n<p>This past September was another one of those times, I received the call from Mom, \"Grandpa is in the hospital, you better stop by, doctors are not optimistic.\" And so it goes, I made a visit. This time, I was going to visit with my grandpa on the terms that I wanted to hear from him, I was going to ask him the difficult question, \"Where do you want to die, Grandpa?\"</p>\n<p>It's not an easy question to ask, but it's an important question that everyone should be asked and discuss with loved ones time and again before a crisis arises, before a serious illness takes over, before loved-ones are not able to make their own wishes known to their family. This was a question that was not asked of my grandpa, nor was it discussed with the family. If ever the subject was brought up, the response was \"Grandpa wants what his doctors want; as long as Grandpa can make his own decisions he wants everything done to keep him alive.\"</p>\n<p>What does that mean to \"have everything done?\" What about the risks? What about Grandpa's goals and wishes for living life? What does that look like? How do we carry out those wishes? What if this and what if that? Do the doctors know best? Does Grandpa know best? Who knows best? At the age of 88, my Grandpa, with a heart condition and cancer, what would be his best life? What does Grandpa know about his illnesses and current condition? So many questions and really no answers or plans for a future life of living his best life with the life he had left to live.</p>\n<p>Grandpa passed away February 7, at home, at the lake, comfortable, at peace and with loved ones by his side.</p>\n<p>Was this the best option for Grandpa's end of life journey? Was it what he wanted? Was it what he expected? He shared that day in the hospital that he wanted to go home, to the lake where he loved to be, he wanted to be comfortable and he wanted to be around his family. It was that time in his life, at the age of 88, that an Advance Care Directive was completed, a guide to Grandpa's wishes for living his best life at the end of life.</p>\n<p>Do you have these same questions, unsure of how to go about planning for your best life at end of life? Concerned about the what, where, when, how and why of having end of life plans. For me, having worked at Heartland Hospice for the past three years I have had the privilege of educating our community on the importance of planning for end of life.</p>\n<p>On April 16, 2016, join us, in partnership with Essentia Health and Crow Wing Energized to learn about the importance of aging in place.

Her father was a farmer and her mother a school teacher. Dorothy followed in her parents’ footsteps enjoying the outdoors and teaching Sunday school for forty years. Her interest and passion in education led to a move from a two-room school house to a newly built school, Carrie E. Gould Elementary.</p>\n<p>Dorothy married Robert in 1942, moved to Savannah, GA and together they had three children. When reflecting on her life, Dorothy stated, “I have had a wonderful life doing what I love, especially helping others.” With her husband and family, she learned to shoot rifles, eventually acquiring 36 medals in competitions. This impressive woman learned to hunt deer, fish and water ski in addition to her incredible rifle skills.</p>\n<p>In 2007, she moved to Brunswick to be near her daughter and resides at a local nursing center. Dorothy loves the interaction with others and having her daughter nearby. “Being with Heartland Hospice has given my mother more care and quality care. During this pandemic, it has given me a peace of mind that she has extra hands-on care and I get regular updates. It has been extremely rough not being able to hug and love on her,” said her daughter, Alice.</p>\n<p>Dorothy is the epitome of a true southern lady and we are honored to be able to care for her and her family.</p>\n\n\n                </div>\n            </div>        </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n                </div>\n    </div>\n\n\n\t                  <a class=\"close-icon popup_amodern-1_close\">\n\t                    <img src=\"/css/images/x-close-navy.svg\" alt=\"close-icon\">\n\t                </a>\n\t            "

He was mistaken.</p>\n<p>Representatives from American Legion Southeast Georgia delivered a medal in a ceremony at his home, one he never expected. Dennis Norris, the American Legion’s District Commander, said it was his honor of presenting the medal, which his organization made happen with the help of the Korean embassy.</p>\n<p>‘This is a medal given to volunteers who served during the Korean War,’ Dennis said. The recognition happened thanks to officials from Heartland Hospice serving Southeast Georgia who is currently providing care for Isaac that contacted the American Legion.</p>\n<p>The former sailor served four years in the Navy, with much of his time aboard the battleship USS Iowa, where he was a fire control officer. His job was to give the coordinates to enable the big guns on the battleship to accurately lob projectiles at targets as far as 33 miles away.</p>\n<p>The battleship successfully targeted North Korean supply lines, industrial complexes, rail and transportation centers and a major ammunition dump during the war. ‘I’m proud to see you served aboard the Iowa,’ Dennis said. Isaac said he enlisted in the Navy for four years, rather than risk being drafted in the Army. ‘I just wanted to do my time,’ he said.</p>\n<p>He was also presented copies of the medals he earned during his service, including the Good Conduct Medal, National Defense Service Medal, Korean Service Medal, United Nations Medal and the Republic of Korea Presidential Unit Citation.</p>\n<p>‘Most everyone who serves in the military is a hero,’ said Bennie Williams, Commander of the American Legion post in Brunswick.</p>\n<p>Isaac was surrounded by family members during the ceremony, including his wife Lenore, siblings, children, well-wishers and the contingent of American Legion members on hand to present the award.</p>\n<p>Lenore Aldridge said her husband’s health problems prevented him from expressing his full appreciation for the honor, but she knows him well enough to understand how excited he was.</p>\n<p>‘I’m overwhelmed,’ she said. ‘He’s feeling it in his heart. It means a lot to him.’</p>\n<p>Isaac Aldridge said he took advantage of the GI Bill when he left the Navy and had a long career in the insurance business, including 20 years at Farm Bureau Insurance. He said the attention showered on him during Friday’s ceremony was an unexpected surprise. ‘I don’t know how to describe it,’ he said. ‘I don’t deserve it, but I appreciate it.’”</p>\n<p>To see the original article, <a href=\"http://goldenisles.news/news/local_news/hospice-bound-navy-vet-honored-for-service-during-korean-war/article_1974999d-b6b3-5f7c-8071-004d2655948f.html\" target=\"_blank\">click here</a>.</p>\n\n\n                </div>\n            </div>        </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n                </div>\n    </div>\n\n\n\t                  <a class=\"close-icon popup_hospice-4_close\">\n\t                    <img src=\"/css/images/x-close-navy.svg\" alt=\"close-icon\">\n\t                </a>\n\t            "

I sat at his bedside at eye level and told him, <em>just look at me</em>,” explained Tina.</p>\n<p>Tina continued to talk quietly to the patient while holding his hand and keeping him calm. At one point, he spoke two words to her, “thank you.” His family later told Tina those were the first words he had spoken in the last few days. She never left his bedside and was with him as he took his last breath. Tina explains, “He comforted me just as much as I comforted him. He also reminded me that sometimes schedules and plans are not the most important part of my job.”</p>\n<p>“I firmly believe we are put exactly where we are meant to be and I was supposed to be there with him. Death is as much a part of life as being born. Someone transitioning deserves the same love and compassion as a new baby entering the world. This patient shared his last hours of life with me. That is truly the highest honor and privilege I could ever hope for,” added Tina.</p>\n\n\n                </div>\n            </div>        </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n                </div>\n    </div>\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t                </section>\n\t\t\t\t              <a class=\"close-icon popup_beingthe4_close\">\n\t\t\t\t                <img src=\"/css/images/x-close-navy.svg\" alt=\"close-icon\">\n\t\t\t\t            </a>\n\t\t\t\t        "

I sat at his bedside at eye level and told him, <em>just look at me</em>,” explained Tina.</p>\n<p>Tina continued to talk quietly to the patient while holding his hand and keeping him calm. At one point, he spoke two words to her, “thank you.” His family later told Tina those were the first words he had spoken in the last few days. She never left his bedside and was with him as he took his last breath. Tina explains, “He comforted me just as much as I comforted him. He also reminded me that sometimes schedules and plans are not the most important part of my job.”</p>\n<p>“I firmly believe we are put exactly where we are meant to be and I was supposed to be there with him. Death is as much a part of life as being born. Someone transitioning deserves the same love and compassion as a new baby entering the world. This patient shared his last hours of life with me. That is truly the highest honor and privilege I could ever hope for,” added Tina.</p>\n\n\n                </div>\n            </div>        </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n                </div>\n    </div>\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t                </section>\n\t\t\t\t              <a class=\"close-icon popup_beingthe4_close\">\n\t\t\t\t                <img src=\"/css/images/x-close-navy.svg\" alt=\"close-icon\">\n\t\t\t\t            </a>\n\t\t\t\t        "

Currently, six seamstress volunteers devote their time and talent to provide Memory Bears to grieving family members.</span></p>\n<p><span>Memory bears are made from the clothing of a patient who has passed. Gillian Dorn, Memory Bear seamstress since 2011 explained, “Because the materials used for the bears are clothing items the loved one actually wore, they become the personality of the bear. Making each bear is a chance to visualize and know the loved one. I <em>talk</em> to the bear as it is being assembled and take pride at the finished result.&nbsp; For me, I enjoy making Memory Bears because I have seen the joy they bring to the families. When they see Mom’s favorite dress in the form of a little bear they can hold and nestle, it brings a softness to their heart and a smile to their face.”</span></p>\n<p><span>To begin the project, Debra Toole, CVA, CDP, Heartland Volunteer Coordinator, interviews the family to learn facts and special interests about their loved one such as sports teams, hobbies, employment, gardening, etc. This information is shared with the seamstresses to help them to individualize the bear to the loved one it represents. Each bear is hand tailored from material items such as shirts, pants, sweat clothes, dresses, sweaters, hats, blankets, and more. It takes two to three months for the bears to be created by the seamstress volunteers. Heartland’s Volunteer Department offers this program as a part of the bereavement process.</span></p>\n<p><span>“It really has become an honor for me to make Memory Bears as it truly comes from my heart,” said Julee Schwieger, Memory Bear seamstress since 2013. “As I’m making them, they start to take shape and almost come to life in a way that I’ve actually created this character of remembrance. It lets me realize that once my work is done, it’s bringing joy to loved ones that will remain priceless.”</span></p>\n<p><span>Heartland holds a special ceremonial program where they present the bear to family members. This gathering provides grieving families an opportunity to share the story of their loved one. Gillian said, “It’s wonderful to see the faces of the families as they arrive at the Memory Bear presentations. They see all the varied bears displayed around the room and they look for that one familiar one. When they see their bears close up, their faces light up with fond memories. It’s very gratifying; I’ve helped somebody by just sewing up a bear!”</span></p>\n\n\n                </div>\n            </div>        </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n                </div>\n    </div>\n\n\n\t                  <a class=\"close-icon popup_heartlan3_close\">\n\t                    <img src=\"/css/images/x-close-navy.svg\" alt=\"close-icon\">\n\t                </a>\n\t            "

The phrase became the rally cry and a mindset that has since motivated the orange-clad believers. One of those ‘all in’ believers is our patient, Thomas.</p>\n<p>Jill, Heartland RN, had been taking care of Thomas for several weeks. They quickly grew close and Jill became a staple to the Thomas family as she developed trust and rapport with Thomas’s wife and son. Over time when Thomas started to decline, he remained comfortable, peaceful and ‘all in’.</p>\n<p>I was having lunch with Jill and she mentioned Thomas’s birthday was coming up. She was planning to visit him and deliver a birthday card. While Jill is a devout Carolina fan (Clemson’s biggest rival), I knew she would be ‘all in’ for his birthday. In true Jill-form, she orchestrated our chaplain, Kevin, and social worker, Linda, to be there with her during the birthday celebration for Thomas. There were big balloons and of course, a special cake with Clemson colors. Jill and Linda wore Carolina shirts to bring a playful rivalry to the party but made sure to also give Thomas Clemson treats inside his Clemson adorned bag to help make his birthday even more special. Shortly after his party, Thomas passed away peacefully at home surrounded by his family and friends.</p>\n<p>Kindness costs nothing. Our team goes above and beyond, not just for Thomas, but for all our patients and their families to ensure a meaningful experience with us during their hospice journey. The team is ‘all in’ every single day and I couldn’t be more grateful for them.”</p>\n\n\n                </div>\n            </div>        </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n    <div>\n        <div class=\"container\">\n        <div class=\"row clearfix\">\n            <div class=\"span4 col\">\n                <div style=\"width: 100%;\">\n                </div>\n            </div>            <div class=\"span4 col\">\n                <div style=\"width: 100%;\">\n                            \n    \n    <img src=\"/media/9841/ryan-2.jpg\" class=\"responsiveImg\">\n\n\n                </div>\n            </div>            <div class=\"span4 col\">\n                <div style=\"width: 100%;\">\n                </div>\n            </div>        </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n                </div>\n    </div>\n\n\n\t                  <a class=\"close-icon popup_heartlan1_close\">\n\t                    <img src=\"/css/images/x-close-navy.svg\" alt=\"close-icon\">\n\t                </a>\n\t            "

Jacquelyn “Kaye” Holman, Heartland Hospice Nurse, and Elaine talk about riding as they both are avid horse enthusiasts. Kaye could see the happiness in Elaine’s face during their conversations and decided that it was time to help Elaine ride again.</p>\n<p>Elaine now spends her days on her beautiful farm; relaxing on the large and cozy screened in porch overlooking the pastures and her two horses, Billy and Pippin. Elaine retired several years ago as a Captain for the Federal Government. She worked as a speech therapist at the Marine Air Corp Station in Beaufort and recruited specialty physicians from all over the country to rural counties of The Low Country. She proposed and created a national Healthcare program for the homeless men and women across the country and helped to provide mental health services for those who are diagnosed and living with HIV.</p>\n<p>On a warm Sunday afternoon in June, Kaye and a friend wanted to help bring happiness and peace to Elaine. They were able to help Elaine get back on the saddle and ride her beloved horse Billy. “This is a dream Elaine had as she has not been able to ride for 8 years. I had the ability to make it happen and wanted to help her make her dream come true,” said Kaye.</p>\n<p>Elaine’s birthday is coming up in July, and when asked what she wanted for her birthday, she replied, “I got it today. What more could you want! Trotting with Billy and seeing all the smiling faces. I liked seeing everyone having a good time.” Elaine received the gift of a beautiful ride with her hospice team providing support and giving her the opportunity to make memories she will never forget with her friends watching and cheering her on.</p>\n<p>“Kaye and Elaine have a very special bond, and it is truly apparent. Kaye builds remarkable relationships with her patients and caregivers. In addition to being a nurse, she is a friend, encouraging and truly wants to bring happiness to each patient she serves. And though Elaine expressed her appreciation for the Heartland Hospice team, it is the joy, happiness and smiles from our patients that is truly the gift. What a gift hospice can bring; care, compassion and horseback riding,” said Dori, Heartland Hospice Administrator.</p>\n\n\n                </div>\n            </div>        </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n    <div>\n        <div class=\"container\">\n        <div class=\"row clearfix\">\n            <div class=\"span4 col\">\n                <div style=\"width: 100%;\">\n                            \n    \n    <img src=\"/media/8519/elaines-horse-billy-3.jpg\" class=\"responsiveImg\">\n\n\n                </div>\n            </div>            <div class=\"span4 col\">\n                <div style=\"width: 100%;\">\n                            \n    \n    <img src=\"/media/8522/kaye-looking-at-elaine.jpg\" class=\"responsiveImg\">\n\n\n                </div>\n            </div>            <div class=\"span4 col\">\n                <div style=\"width: 100%;\">\n                            \n    \n    <img src=\"/media/8523/kaye-with-elaine-riding.jpg\" class=\"responsiveImg\">\n\n\n                </div>\n            </div>        </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n                </div>\n    </div>\n\n\n\t                  <a class=\"close-icon popup_heartlan4_close\">\n\t                    <img src=\"/css/images/x-close-navy.svg\" alt=\"close-icon\">\n\t                </a>\n\t            "

The pantry is an area where students, families and staff in need can go for many different items, free of charge. The items range from uniforms, to personal care, to groceries.</p>\n<p>The ProMedica Hospice team also held a “Penny War” to help collect money. Six teams within the agency collected change for their designated bins for six weeks. After six weeks, $500 had been collected and the money was donated to The Summit Academy so they can give students prizes and a pizza party this year.</p>\n<p>ProMedica Hospice is proud to be a community partner and support those in Southwest Ohio!</p>\n\n\n                </div>\n            </div>        </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n    <div>\n        <div class=\"container\">\n        <div class=\"row clearfix\">\n            <div class=\"span4 col\">\n                <div style=\"width: 100%;\">\n                            \n    \n    <img src=\"/media/11915/personal-care.jpg\" class=\"responsiveImg\">\n\n\n                </div>\n            </div>            <div class=\"span4 col\">\n                <div style=\"width: 100%;\">\n                            \n    \n    <img src=\"/media/11917/supplies.jpg\" class=\"responsiveImg\">\n\n\n                </div>\n            </div>            <div class=\"span4 col\">\n                <div style=\"width: 100%;\">\n                            \n    \n    <img src=\"/media/11918/uniforms.jpg\" class=\"responsiveImg\">\n\n\n                </div>\n            </div>        </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n                </div>\n    </div>\n\n\n\t                  <a class=\"close-icon popup_promedic1_close\">\n\t                    <img src=\"/css/images/x-close-navy.svg\" alt=\"close-icon\">\n\t                </a>\n\t            "

Mike had contacted Belterra Park as the patient’s “Perfect Day” included watching a horse race. He coordinated with Rey Warren, Belterra’s b-connected coordinator, and they arranged for the patient and his wife to watch the race in their Black and Gold Room, a personal suite with all the amenities. The patient was scheduled to be on the jumbotron, to call a race over the mic and to have his picture taken with some of the horses. Unfortunately, the patient passed away before he was able to experience his “Perfect Day”.</p>\n<p>Since the patient passed, Rey still wanted to do something for the patient’s wife. He gathered meaningful mementos from all the jockeys, including an autographed hat, t-shirt and goggles that some wore during their most recent races. One of those jockeys was the youngest to have ever won the Triple Crown. Though the patient was unable to experience his “Perfect Day”, it was meaningful for Mike and Rey to present these mementos in his honor to his wife.</p>\n\n\n                </div>\n            </div>        </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n    <div>\n        <div class=\"container\">\n        <div class=\"row clearfix\">\n            <div class=\"span6 col\">\n                <div style=\"width: 100%;\">\n                            \n    \n    <img src=\"/media/10755/signed-items-jockeys-cinci-2.jpg\" class=\"responsiveImg\">\n\n\n                </div>\n            </div>            <div class=\"span6 col\">\n                <div style=\"width: 100%;\">\n                            \n    \n    <img src=\"/media/10756/signed-items-jockeys-cinci-3.jpg\" class=\"responsiveImg\">\n\n\n                </div>\n            </div>        </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n                </div>\n    </div>\n\n\n\t                  <a class=\"close-icon popup_wiferece2_close\">\n\t                    <img src=\"/css/images/x-close-navy.svg\" alt=\"close-icon\">\n\t                </a>\n\t            "

Julie Moores, Regional Manager of Business Development, recently received upsetting news that her best friend for several decades, Mike’s, cancer had returned. She helped him with receiving hospice services and knew her Heartland Hospice serving Southwest Ohio team would take amazing care of him during this difficult time.</p>\n<p>Mike is a life-long Star Trek fan and through the many years of their friendship, this was made very clear to Julie through Star Trek discussions, memorabilia, watching the series numerous times and much more. While discussing life, the difficulties of the past year and the recent devastating news about Mike’s health, Julie wanted to do something extra special for her friend and something she knew would fulfill one of Mike’s life-long dreams. She wanted to go the extra mile to let her best friend know how much she truly cares about him and surprise him with messages he will <em>never</em> forget!</p>\n<p>Julie reached out to the ProMedica Hospice Memorial Fund, formerly Heartland Hospice Memorial Fund, for help. From there, everything fell into place perfectly and Julie was able to give Mike the surprise of a lifetime!</p>\n<p>“Mike was hospitalized for almost five months last year. After his stay, he was sent home with a plan that he would be on the road to recovery. A few weeks after his return home, he had a follow-up scan that showed his cancer had returned and spread to multiple areas. Due to the aggressive nature of his type of cancer, his oncologist only expected him to live two more months. This was a terrible shock to all of us, especially his significant other, Ben. Mike and Ben are the kindest and funniest people I have ever known, so I really wanted to do something that would brighten their days and help them to feel special during such a difficult time. I thought it would be a great idea to reach out and try to get personal video messages from some of their favorite Star Trek actors.</p>\n<p>We received messages from Brent Spiner, who portrayed Data on the series, and Jonathan Frakes, who portrayed Riker. When I showed the videos, Mike and Ben were beyond excited but also shocked that we were able to obtain personal messages! Mike said, ‘I can’t believe you guys would do this for me. I want these videos burned to a flash drive so they can be placed in my urn with my ashes so I can keep them always!’</p>\n<p>Mike has always been someone who does kind gestures for other without any thought of himself. Being able to surprise him with these videos was incredibly meaningful to me and the hospice team. As one of my closest friends, to see the smiles, laughter and even tears of happiness that were the result of these videos was a fantastic experience, especially since there has been so much recent sadness. I am beyond thankful to the Southwest Ohio team for providing compassionate care to my friend and to the ProMedica Hospice Memorial Fund for helping make Mike’s final days a dream come true.”</p>\n<p><a rel=\"noopener\" href=\"https://www.cameo.com/v/5ff8a54371a8a2001d7a6147?utm_campaign=video_share_to_copy\" target=\"_blank\">Brent Spiner’s Video Message</a></p>\n\n\n                </div>\n            </div>        </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n    <div>\n        <div class=\"container\">\n        <div class=\"row clearfix\">\n            <div class=\"span4 col\">\n                <div style=\"width: 100%;\">\n                            \n    \n    <img src=\"/media/10071/mike-2.jpg\" class=\"responsiveImg\">\n\n\n                </div>\n            </div>            <div class=\"span4 col\">\n                <div style=\"width: 100%;\">\n                            \n    \n    <img src=\"/media/10069/julie-mike.jpg\" class=\"responsiveImg\">\n\n\n                </div>\n            </div>            <div class=\"span4 col\">\n                <div style=\"width: 100%;\">\n                            \n    \n    <img src=\"/media/10072/mike.jpg\" class=\"responsiveImg\">\n\n\n                </div>\n            </div>        </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n                </div>\n    </div>\n\n\n\t                  <a class=\"close-icon popup_hospicep4_close\">\n\t                    <img src=\"/css/images/x-close-navy.svg\" alt=\"close-icon\">\n\t                </a>\n\t            "

Upon hearing Cricket’s wish, Kristen contacted Monica McKee, Heartland Hospice Account Liaison, and they came up with the idea that the Heartland Hospice team would bring Disney World to her. Monica reached out to Fresenius Dialysis Center Washington Court House, where Crickett receives her treatment, to see if Heartland could have a celebration at their facility on a day that she would be scheduled. Marissa Parsley, Fresenius Dialysis Center Manager, jumped on the suggestion and together with Heartland was able to create a “Disney World” at the center. “Everything came together wonderfully. It was so great to work as a team to make this happen!” said Marissa. “I’m so grateful to work with such an awesome team, and to be able to partner with Marissa and her team. Crickett may not have been able to travel to Disney World, but we brought a little bit of Disney to her,” said Monica.</p>\n<p>Several staff members from Heartland and Fresenius Dialysis Center dressed up as Disney characters to surprise Crickett with a Disney party before her treatment.

It was wonderful!” said Crickett.</p>\n\n\n                </div>\n            </div>        </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n    <div>\n        <div class=\"container\">\n        <div class=\"row clearfix\">\n            <div class=\"span4 col\">\n                <div style=\"width: 100%;\">\n                            \n    \n    <img src=\"/media/8689/disney-3.jpg\" class=\"responsiveImg\">\n\n\n                </div>\n            </div>            <div class=\"span4 col\">\n                <div style=\"width: 100%;\">\n                            \n    \n    <img src=\"/media/8691/disney-5.jpg\" class=\"responsiveImg\">\n\n\n                </div>\n            </div>            <div class=\"span4 col\">\n                <div style=\"width: 100%;\">\n                            \n    \n    <img src=\"/media/8690/disney-4-edited.jpg\" class=\"responsiveImg\">\n\n\n                </div>\n            </div>        </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n    <div>\n        <div class=\"container\">\n        <div class=\"row clearfix\">\n            <div class=\"span4 col\">\n                <div style=\"width: 100%;\">\n                            \n    \n    <img src=\"/media/8694/disney-8.jpg\" class=\"responsiveImg\">\n\n\n                </div>\n            </div>            <div class=\"span4 col\">\n                <div style=\"width: 100%;\">\n                            \n    \n    <img src=\"/media/8693/disney-7.jpg\" class=\"responsiveImg\">\n\n\n                </div>\n            </div>            <div class=\"span4 col\">\n                <div style=\"width: 100%;\">\n                            \n    \n    <img src=\"/media/8696/disney-10.jpg\" class=\"responsiveImg\">\n\n\n                </div>\n            </div>        </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n                </div>\n    </div>\n\n\n\t                  <a class=\"close-icon popup_heartlan2_close\">\n\t                    <img src=\"/css/images/x-close-navy.svg\" alt=\"close-icon\">\n\t                </a>\n\t            "

Shirley grew up in New York and later moved to Ohio and raised her two children. She was a United Church minister who cared for the sick in her community. Even though she is from New York, she is a lifelong Cleveland Indians fan and never had the opportunity to attend a game. It was her dream to see the team she loves in person, to hear the drum beat before each pitch, to see the “beer guy” walking the stands and to eat a stadium hotdog.</p>\n<p>On August 25, 2019, through the Cleveland Indians partnership with the Major League Baseball Commissioner’s Community Initiative, Shirley was finally able to attend a Cleveland Indians baseball game with her family, Heartland Hospice and Heartland of Mentor staff. Once Shirley arrived at Progressive Field to watch her team, she received a “First Visit to Progressive Field” certificate from the Fan Ambassadors.</p>\n<p>All throughout the game, Fan Ambassadors came to visit with Shirley and gave her endless amounts of Tribe memorabilia, including bags filled with a hat donated by CLE Clothing Co., a Clevinger bobblehead, a game ball with a little extra dirt from the field, and more! They gave Shirley a tour of the stadium on the way to the dugout for her to finish watching the game when it went into extra innings. While Shirley was being escorted to the dugout area, she ran into several of the stadium mascots: Ketchup, Onion and Mustard. She was asked to run the bases and represent Mustard during her run. Shirley was smiling the whole time while on Progressive Field running the bases, and Mustard helped her to reach home plate before Ketchup and Onion!</p>\n<p>“I cannot thank everyone enough for the love and care that has been provided to my mother and our family. Thank you from the bottom of my heart. For what you did and how you put yourselves out there, to take your own personal time for my mom is just beyond words for me,” said Debby Lurch, Shirley’s daughter.</p>\n<p>“We will be forever grateful to the Cleveland Indians organization for the gift they gave to Shirley and her family that day. Witnessing Shirley’s smile and the reaction of her family was one of the most rewarding moments of my career,” said Sarah Davis, RN, Heartland Hospice Director of Professional Services.</p>\n<p>“Her smile will leave an impression on me the rest of my life. I’m a lifelong Cleveland Indians fan and have many memories at the ballpark, but that day with Shirley will forever be my favorite!” said Krysta Falasca, Heartland Hospice Volunteer Coordinator.</p>\n<p>“My biggest impression from the day was Shirley’s smile that lasted the entire time. For a patient who sometimes has trouble staying awake during activities, it was just incredible to see how happy and engaged she was the entire time,” said Gloria Basista, Heartland Hospice RN Case Manager.</p>\n<p>“It was an incredible amount of team work that came from all aspects of hospice to make her day memorable. It was a really nice experience to be with the people I see every day in the office or field, but in a new way to build our relationships and comradery. This was my first time at a game too, and it was an awesome experience,” said Beth Hakli, Heartland Hospice RN Case Manager.</p>\n<p>A big thank you goes out to everyone who assisted in making Shirley’s dream come true: Tricia Vidovic, Arden Courts of Chagrin Falls Marketing Director; Anthony Overton, Heartland Hospice Manager of Business Development; Sarah Davis, Heartland Hospice Senior Director of Professional Services; Krysta Falasca, Heartland Hospice Volunteer Coordinator; Fan Ambassadors including Megan Evans and Abi Rathbone at Progressive Field; the Cleveland Indians and of course Shirley Malzer for letting Heartland be a part of her dream!</p>\n<p>Shirley’s smile was contagious to everyone around her the entire day.

Staff members made her Heart’s Desire come true by providing Alice with a 2-night stay in Manhattan, along with tickets for a Broadway musical.</p>\n<p>The summer after Alice graduated college, she was a cocktail waitress at the World’s Fair in Manhattan. From that point on, she fell in love with the city, and in her earlier years was able to visit and attend Broadway shows with her friends. “I love New York. I love the feel of New York. I worked the World’s Fair there after college, and it was magical! I would love to walk the streets of Manhattan with my friends one more time,” said Alice.</p>\n<p>The event was made possible after Janette Branham, Director of Nursing at Wyngate Assisted Living, reached out to Monica McKee, Account Liaison with Heartland Hospice, to help put together the trip for Alice. “It was extremely special to be a part of organizing this trip and we’re blessed to be able to partner with Jamie’s Dream Team on making Alice’s wish come true,” said Monica.</p>\n<p>Alice’s trip started with a Send-Off Celebration at Wyngate Assisted Living where everyone gathered to wish her a safe and enjoyable trip. She then traveled to New York City with Jeannette and her friends Connie and Linda. They ate lots of wonderful food, walked with Alice on the streets on Manhattan and went with her to see the Broadway show “Ain’t Too Proud – The Life and Times of the Temptations.” Everyone enjoyed their time together to make this a special trip for their friend, Alice. When asked how her trip was, Alice said, “Words cannot express.” Jeannette said, “Wow, this was such an amazing experience. I cannot thank Heartland Hospice and Monica enough. I told Alice how blessed I am to be a part of her life and she replied ‘vise-versa’.”</p>\n\n\n                </div>\n            </div>        </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n    <div>\n        <div class=\"container\">\n        <div class=\"row clearfix\">\n            <div class=\"span4 col\">\n                <div style=\"width: 100%;\">\n                            \n    \n    <img src=\"/media/8458/1.jpg\" class=\"responsiveImg\">\n\n\n                </div>\n            </div>            <div class=\"span4 col\">\n                <div style=\"width: 100%;\">\n                            \n    \n    <img src=\"/media/8459/2.jpg\" class=\"responsiveImg\">\n\n\n                </div>\n            </div>            <div class=\"span4 col\">\n                <div style=\"width: 100%;\">\n                            \n    \n    <img src=\"/media/8465/8.jpg\" class=\"responsiveImg\">\n\n\n                </div>\n            </div>        </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n    <div>\n        <div class=\"container\">\n        <div class=\"row clearfix\">\n            <div class=\"span4 col\">\n                <div style=\"width: 100%;\">\n                            \n    \n    <img src=\"/media/8461/4.jpg\" class=\"responsiveImg\">\n\n\n                </div>\n            </div>            <div class=\"span4 col\">\n                <div style=\"width: 100%;\">\n                            \n    \n    <img src=\"/media/8466/9.jpg\" class=\"responsiveImg\">\n\n\n                </div>\n            </div>            <div class=\"span4 col\">\n                <div style=\"width: 100%;\">\n                            \n    \n    <img src=\"/media/8464/7.jpg\" class=\"responsiveImg\">\n\n\n                </div>\n            </div>        </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n                </div>\n    </div>\n\n\n\t                  <a class=\"close-icon popup_heartlan2_close\">\n\t                    <img src=\"/css/images/x-close-navy.svg\" alt=\"close-icon\">\n\t                </a>\n\t            "

Suzanne understands the importance that animals play in the lives of hospice patients and shares her experience with the Pet Peace of Mind program.</p>\n<p>“It has been a gift to visit with the patients on our hospice services and witness the comfort their pets bring them. I enjoy my role as a friendly visit volunteer, but when I noticed the need to help the patients when it became difficult for them to properly care for their pets, I reached out to Pet Peace of Mind. PPOM provided our agency with the platform to help those patients find the care needed for their pets while still staying connected to them during end-of-life. It meant so much to me that our volunteer coordinator entrusted me to organize and administer the program, which expanded the range of services available to the patients, their families and now their pets. I love seeing how this program has brought comfort to the patients and our team. We didn’t realize how much this type of program was needed in the Quad Cities.”</p>\n<p>Jeffrey Blackwell, ProMedica Hospice volunteer coordinator, submitted a thoughtful nomination to PPOM recognizing Suzanne and her dedication to patients, their families and their pets.</p>\n<p>\"Suzanne is a hospice volunteer and because of her love of helping people at the end of life and her compassion for animals, she has taken the idea of PPOM and made it a reality for our patients, their pets and, in many cases, their families.</p>\n<p>Suzanne practices what she preaches. It began during a visit when the hospice patient asked Suzanne to foster their cat, Ghost. When they were near their end-of-life, the patient then asked Suzanne to adopt Ghost knowing how well she has taken care of them. Suzanne respected the patient’s wishes and is now the new ‘mom’ to Ghost.</p>\n<p>Suzanne is the heart and soul of our PPOM program here in the Quad Cities. Her compassion for the patients and their pets encouraged us to formally handle these situations through PPOM. Everything that has happened to make our PPOM program work is the result of her initial and continued kindness and compassion for our patients and their beloved pets.”</p>\n\n\n                </div>\n            </div>        </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n                </div>\n    </div>\n\n\n\t                  <a class=\"close-icon popup_promedic1_close\">\n\t                    <img src=\"/css/images/x-close-navy.svg\" alt=\"close-icon\">\n\t                </a>\n\t            "

She collaborated with Linda to propose to me a team of volunteers and their dogs becoming part of the Heartland volunteer team.”</p>\n<p>“The pet therapy volunteer team visits at patients’ windows whenever it is possible. This is a great option during a time where many facilities are not allowing visitors. The response from patients and staff at the facilities has exceeded our expectations! The pet therapy team brings a needed break throughout the day and the dogs instinctively know how to delight the patients,” Jeff added.</p>\n<p>Michele, Account Liaison, visited Centennial Rehab &amp; Healthcare with the pet therapy team for one of their first group visits. “This group of volunteers and their dogs has brought so much joy and great energy to the patients and residents. It brought tears to my eyes to see the looks of surprise and smiles on the patients’ faces as the dogs visited their windows,” said Michele. “This was such a wonderful way to serve our patients and the staff at the facility during such a difficult time.”</p>\n\n\n                </div>\n            </div>        </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n    <div>\n        <div class=\"container\">\n        <div class=\"row clearfix\">\n            <div class=\"span6 col\">\n                <div style=\"width: 100%;\">\n                            \n    \n    <img src=\"/media/9298/2.jpg\" class=\"responsiveImg\">\n\n\n                </div>\n            </div>            <div class=\"span6 col\">\n                <div style=\"width: 100%;\">\n                            \n    \n    <img src=\"/media/9300/4.jpg\" class=\"responsiveImg\">\n\n\n                </div>\n            </div>        </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n    <div>\n        <div class=\"container\">\n        <div class=\"row clearfix\">\n            <div class=\"span6 col\">\n                <div style=\"width: 100%;\">\n                            \n    \n    <img src=\"/media/9297/1.jpg\" class=\"responsiveImg\">\n\n\n                </div>\n            </div>            <div class=\"span6 col\">\n                <div style=\"width: 100%;\">\n                            \n    \n    <img src=\"/media/9299/3.jpg\" class=\"responsiveImg\">\n\n\n                </div>\n            </div>        </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n                </div>\n    </div>\n\n\n\t                  <a class=\"close-icon popup_heartlan3_close\">\n\t                    <img src=\"/css/images/x-close-navy.svg\" alt=\"close-icon\">\n\t                </a>\n\t            "

Amber coordinated an event for Greenville Health and Rehab to lift the spirits of the residents and staff. The event included yard signs and balloons, a parking lot parade with police and community members, dinner for the staff and a ceremony with prayers for the safety of residents, staff and the community. Amber is honored to be recognized and told about her experience planning this event:</p>\n<p>“I started my career at Heartland of Greenville in 2008 and transferred to Heartland Hospice in 2014. Both of my maternal grandparents lived at Heartland of Greenville and both passed away on our hospice service. I spent a lot of time at Greenville Health and Rehab (formerly known as Heartland of Greenville) since my grandparents were there and I worked there. This building is obviously very special to me.”</p>\n<p>“Planning the event was all done via email, texts and phone calls. We couldn't meet up in person and discuss ideas because of the social distancing order. I have an unbelievable group of friends who jumped at the idea of this event. We worked together as a team to get it organized properly and cautiously so in the end, Greenville Heath and Rehab’s staff and patients knew that the town of Greenville is praying and thinking of them!”</p>\n<p>“Everyone kept their distance from each other at the event. Families stood at the closed&nbsp;windows of their loved ones, others stood next to or inside of their vehicles and masks were worn. Law enforcement was there to show support and to ensure all social distancing orders were being followed. I saw the patients smiling and waving and I saw staff members crying tears of appreciation. It was a truly special day.”</p>\n\n\n                </div>\n            </div>        </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n    <div>\n        <div class=\"container\">\n        <div class=\"row clearfix\">\n            <div class=\"span12 col\">\n                <div style=\"width: 100%;\">\n                            \n    \n    <img src=\"/media/9173/amber-shepherd-sign.jpg\" class=\"responsiveImg\">\n\n\n                </div>\n            </div>        </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n                </div>\n    </div>\n\n\n\t                  <a class=\"close-icon popup_heartlan1_close\">\n\t                    <img src=\"/css/images/x-close-navy.svg\" alt=\"close-icon\">\n\t                </a>\n\t            "

Donna, a resident at Heartland of Beavercreek expressed a heart’s desire to have an opportunity to personally thank her friends and family before she passed. The team agreed that a Celebration of Life Party would give her the chance to fulfill her wish. However, Donna insisted on planning and coordinating the entire party by herself. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>“I wanted to say good-bye in my own way,” commented Donna. “I’ve always liked to do things my way. I love the Heartland Hospice and Heartland of Beavercreek staff…they mean so much to me.”</p>\n<p>The celebration began with a few words from Donna. Then she shared her favorite scriptures from the bible and led the group in singing some of her beloved gospel hymns. Several people stood up to say kind words including friends, family and staff from both Heartland of Beavercreek and Heartland Hospice.</p>\n<p>“We were excited to help Donna with her Celebration of Life Party,” said Casey Howard, Manager of Business of Development for Heartland Hospice. “Donna is such a wonderful person to be around,” he added, “she is always smiling, uplifting, and thankful for all of her friends. It is truly our honor to care for Donna.”</p>\n<p>One of the more touching stories was told by one of Donna’s friends who shared how her relationship with Donna changed her life. She was battling depression and had thoughts of suicide. They became close friends and Donna’s faith and outlook on life helped her friend during this difficult time. The friend ended up moving out of state so Donna’s family paid for her to return to Dayton for Donna’s Celebration of Life party! &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Donna explained, “the celebration was my way of saying good-bye. I want people to think of Christ when they think of me and I want to thank everyone for being my friend.”</p>\n\n\n                            \n    \n    <img src=\"/media/6868/dtodd-2.jpg\" class=\"responsiveImg\">\n\n\n                </div>\n            </div>        </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n                </div>\n    </div>\n\n\n\t                  <a class=\"close-icon popup_heartlan3_close\">\n\t                    <img src=\"/css/images/x-close-navy.svg\" alt=\"close-icon\">\n\t                </a>\n\t            "

Since then, WEAU has shared many special stories and presented the nominations with the entire Western Wisconsin area.</p>\n<p>Tonya Jahnke, stepdaughter of a recent Heartland Hospice patient, nominated Heartland for the award. “I would like to nominate Heartland Hospice for the Sunshine Award. The Heartland nurses and staff cared for my stepfather, Charlie, when he was diagnosed with ALS. During the last days of Charlie’s life, the nurses, Jenna, Julie, Lisa, Scott and so many others, took such amazing care of him and my mom. They were kind, came to the house when we called and took time to explain the plan of care to us. The love and kindness they shared with my mom and our family is so appreciated. Thank you all so much for serving and sharing your hearts with us. We will always remember you!”</p>\n<p>Laurice Hillman, Heartland Hospice Administrator, said, “I am proud of our team and their dedication to being helpful, caring and responsive to our patients and their families. Each team member strives to live our mission of enriching lives and that is evident in the care they provide.”</p>\n<p><a rel=\"noopener\" href=\"https://www.weau.com/content/misc/Heartland-Hospice-571368821.html\" target=\"_blank\">WEAU 13 News Sunshine Award</a></p>\n\n\n                </div>\n            </div>        </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n                </div>\n    </div>\n\n\n\t                  <a class=\"close-icon popup_heartlan1_close\">\n\t                    <img src=\"/css/images/x-close-navy.svg\" alt=\"close-icon\">\n\t                </a>\n\t            "

The wife was distraught and not very clear. I was asked to visit this patient and his family first before going to my other appointments.” &nbsp;</p>\n<p>When Tina arrived the patient was in pain, struggling to breath and very scared. She gave him his medicine and made him comfortable in his bed. “I told him that I would be with him as long as he needed me. I sat at his bedside at eye level and told him, <em>just look at me</em>,” explained Tina.</p>\n<p>Tina continued to talk quietly to the patient while holding his hand and keeping him calm. At one point, he spoke two words to her, “thank you.” His family later told Tina those were the first words he had spoken in the last few days. She never left his bedside and was with him as he took his last breath. Tina explains, “He comforted me just as much as I comforted him. He also reminded me that sometimes schedules and plans are not the most important part of my job.”</p>\n<p>“I firmly believe we are put exactly where we are meant to be and I was supposed to be there with him. Death is as much a part of life as being born. Someone transitioning deserves the same love and compassion as a new baby entering the world. This patient shared his last hours of life with me. That is truly the highest honor and privilege I could ever hope for,” added Tina.</p>\n\n\n                </div>\n            </div>        </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n                </div>\n    </div>\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t                </section>\n\t\t\t\t              <a class=\"close-icon popup_beingthe4_close\">\n\t\t\t\t                <img src=\"/css/images/x-close-navy.svg\" alt=\"close-icon\">\n\t\t\t\t            </a>\n\t\t\t\t        "

Given this information, Michelle contacted her administrator, Jessica Beauchamp to see how they could fulfill her heart’s desire.</p>\n<p>“I knew we had to make this happen for Joan,” said Jessica, “so I quickly made several phone calls and sent some emails to the Redskins.” Jessica received a call from the Manager of Community and Charitable Programs for the Washington Redskins. He guaranteed VIP passes for Joan to attend training camp but he couldn’t promise anything additional.</p>\n<p>On the big day, Jessica escorted Joan to the Redskins training camp facility in Richmond, Virginia. A member of the Charitable Team greeted Joan upon arrival then registered her and the group at the VIP tent. The group was then led to the Owner’s Tent on the practice fields where refreshments and cold drinks were waiting for all. They also helped Joan to get comfortable and out of the direct sunlight as it can exacerbate her condition.</p>\n<p>The Charitable Team presented Joan with a Redskins duffle bag full of team apparel including t-shirts, blankets, hats, socks and even pajama pants. All enjoyed watching the walk through practice session. After an hour of practice, Kirk Cousins stopped by the tent to meet Joan. He gave her his undivided attention and truly fulfilled her last heart’s desire. He signed a football for Joan as well as her shirt and hat. “We are so thankful to the Redskins for allowing Joan to have this incredible moment,” said Jessica.</p>\n\n\n                </div>\n            </div>        </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n    <div>\n        <div class=\"container\">\n        <div class=\"row clearfix\">\n            <div class=\"span12 col\">\n                <div style=\"width: 100%;\">\n                            \n    \n    <img src=\"/media/6734/23.jpg\" class=\"responsiveImg\">\n\n\n                </div>\n            </div>        </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n    <div>\n        <div class=\"container\">\n        <div class=\"row clearfix\">\n            <div class=\"span12 col\">\n                <div style=\"width: 100%;\">\n                            \n    \n    <img src=\"/media/6733/22.jpg\" class=\"responsiveImg\">\n\n\n                </div>\n            </div>        </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n    <div>\n        <div class=\"container\">\n        <div class=\"row clearfix\">\n            <div class=\"span12 col\">\n                <div style=\"width: 100%;\">\n                            \n    \n    <img src=\"/media/6736/24.jpg\" class=\"responsiveImg\">\n\n\n                </div>\n            </div>        </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n    <div>\n        <div class=\"container\">\n        <div class=\"row clearfix\">\n            <div class=\"span12 col\">\n                <div style=\"width: 100%;\">\n                            \n    \n    <img src=\"/media/6735/25.jpg\" class=\"responsiveImg\">\n\n\n                </div>\n            </div>        </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n    <div>\n        <div class=\"container\">\n        <div class=\"row clearfix\">\n            <div class=\"span6 col\">\n                <div style=\"width: 100%;\">\n                            \n    \n    <img src=\"/media/6732/21.jpg\" class=\"responsiveImg\">\n\n\n                </div>\n            </div>            <div class=\"span6 col\">\n                <div style=\"width: 100%;\">\n                            \n    \n    <img src=\"/media/6730/19.jpg\" class=\"responsiveImg\">\n\n\n                </div>\n            </div>        </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n                </div>\n    </div>\n\n\n\t                  <a class=\"close-icon popup_heartlan1_close\">\n\t                    <img src=\"/css/images/x-close-navy.svg\" alt=\"close-icon\">\n\t                </a>\n\t            "

They had to come up with unique ways to stay connected with their patients, family members and facility staff while abiding to visitor restrictions:</p>\n<p>Carla Graves, a Heartland therapy volunteer, contacted local facilities to request permission for her and her therapy dogs, Spirit and Liberty, to have window visits with their patients. Carla, Spirit and Liberty have always been popular visitors with patients. They’re so popular, that even when showing up outside a window for a visit, the Heartland patients recognized them immediately! “I got the idea from Facebook of relatives visiting family members through their windows to communicate. We had not been able to go on any visits for almost a month and Spirit was very restless. He loves seeing ‘his’ people during our regular visits, plus being the center of attention. I contacted the activity directors at the local facilities and asked if they would be interested in the therapy dogs coming and doing some tricks outside the windows where the residents could see them. On our first window visit, I had to chase Spirit because he kept trying to get into the building to be with ‘his’ people like he normally would. Even though this isn’t the optimal therapy dog experience for residents, I think they enjoyed seeing the dogs again,” said Carla.</p>\n<p>Heartland volunteers also began calling skilled nursing facility staff members to personally thank them for their heroic service every day during the pandemic caring for patients and residents. Along with the thank you calls, they also sent cards and notes to patients and family members to stay in touch and offer words of encouragement.</p>\n<p>The Heartland team stays connected to their patient’s by arranging virtual visits, some of who do not have family members to visit them. One volunteer has been sending daily inspirational texts to patients and facility staff members that also include inspiring musical videos. Another volunteer and their spouse made masks to donate to non-clinical staff members at facilities.</p>\n\n\n                            \n    \n    <img src=\"/media/9233/carla-window-visit-with-therapy-dog.jpg\" class=\"responsiveImg\">\n\n\n                </div>\n            </div>        </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n                </div>\n    </div>\n\n\n\t                  <a class=\"close-icon popup_heartlan2_close\">\n\t                    <img src=\"/css/images/x-close-navy.svg\" alt=\"close-icon\">\n\t                </a>\n\t            "

Derek played sports throughout his life, coached his son’s little league team and was a life-long Detroit Tigers fan. Derek started hospice care earlier this year and during one of his visits with Rose, RN Case Manager, he mentioned, “My last wish was to take my sons to a Detroit Tigers game. Getting to experience a game with my sons is on my bucket list.”</p>\n<p>Due to his decline in health, attending a game at Comerica Park would have been his last, but he would have been able to experience both of his sons’ first game. Unfortunately, due to the global pandemic, Major League Baseball games were postponed. The Heartland Hospice team and Derek’s wife, Jill, worked hard to figure out a different way to grant Derek’s last wish.</p>\n<p>While he wasn’t able to take his sons to a game, the Tigers organization surprised Derek with a video conference call with Lance Parrish, who played for Detroit for the majority of his baseball career, and Dan Dickerson, who is the lead radio play-by-play voice of the Tigers on the Detroit Tigers Radio Network.</p>\n<p>Derek, Jill and their sons virtually talked with Lance and Dan, who helped bring a piece of the game to them when no one was able to attend a game. “He was so happy and expressed that he hoped this was something his sons would never forget. The day was a special memory for him and was so positive and comforting during such a difficult time for Derek and his family,” said Rose.</p>\n<p>Thank you to the Detroit Tigers organization for providing Derek and his family with such an amazing experience.</p>\n<p>To see clips of Derek’s conversation with Lance and Dan, <a rel=\"noopener\" href=\"https://mobile.twitter.com/tigers/status/1270456995322253313\" target=\"_blank\">click here</a>.</p>\n\n\n                </div>\n            </div>        </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n                </div>\n    </div>\n\n\n\t                  <a class=\"close-icon popup_heartlan1_close\">\n\t                    <img src=\"/css/images/x-close-navy.svg\" alt=\"close-icon\">\n\t                </a>\n\t            "

My words were well-intentioned and came from a sincere place.</p>\n<p>This was until I met Jim. Jim was introduced to me as a Marine who served in the Korean War; more specifically, the Chosin Reservoir. I instinctively thanked Jim for his service.</p>\n<p>I was not familiar with this battle, the Chosin Reservoir. I did not remember learning about it in high school so long ago and I had never met someone who spoke about it. That night I looked up the Chosin Reservoir.&nbsp; I was in tears. My tears were not because of the insane conditions these men were fighting in—and against.&nbsp; My tears came from a place of embarrassment. I thanked Jim without knowing the true service and sacrifice he gave our country. At this point, my <em>thank you</em> felt empty. I had met someone who fought in one of the most savage battles in Marine Corp history. The next day, I was with Jim again and told him about my research the night before. I offered him an apology for my ignorance when I thanked him the day prior. I asked Jim if I could thank him appropriately. I explained that I had no idea of the battle he served in and thanked him for teaching me a very important lesson that I would remember when thanking Veterans in the future. We embraced and from that day began to develop a strong friendship.</p>\n<p>When Jim and I would meet, I learned a little more about him as a person, as a father, as a husband. I became friends with someone who served as a frontline machine gunner and a squad leader in 5 major battles, including the battle of the Chosin Reservoir. I learned that Jim was a recipient of several military decorations including the Purple Heart Medal for injuries he received on the battlefield. I learned about Jim’s story.</p>\n<p>Those who served in the military have his or her own story surrounding time in service and individual sacrifices were made. Not all stories are the same and not every person has the same experience. The story <em>matters</em> and the individual Veteran <em>matters</em>.</p>\n<p>My lesson: Give <em>intention</em> to my thank you. Before I thank an individual Veteran for his or her service, I ask questions so that I may offer an informed thank you. Some questions I ask: What branch did you serve? When did you serve? How long did you serve? What was your job while serving?</p>\n<p>Nowadays, I am not thanking a Veteran…I am thanking a 'Jim' who enlisted at age 17 and served four years (1948-1952) in the Marine Corp as a machine gunner in the battle of the Chosin Reservoir in the Korean War.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n                </div>\n            </div>        </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n                </div>\n    </div>\n\n\n\t                  <a class=\"close-icon popup_eachindi1_close\">\n\t                    <img src=\"/css/images/x-close-navy.svg\" alt=\"close-icon\">\n\t                </a>\n\t            "

After he returned to the states and started to adjust to life back home, Master Sergeant Kowalski stopped by the Heartland Hospice Serving East Central Wisconsin office to deliver a gift.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It was with great humility and gratitude that he accepted the flag that had been flown on a combat mission over Southwest Asia in an F-22 Raptor, in honor of Heartland Hospice. When asked why he chose to honor us in this way, Master Sergeant Kowalski said, “Because of Heartland’s dedication in providing excellent care to local Veterans.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Master Sergeant Kowalski also presented Heartland with a challenge coin that his unit designed. “These coins are a way to show appreciation and are presented to people for a job well done” he explained. “Collections of challenge coins are often displayed at desks or on a wall so others can observe them as a roadmap of where the coin holder has been.”</p>\n<p>In order to properly display the flag, it was taken to the local American Legion Trier-Puddy Post #75 in Fond du Lac, Wisconsin. Greg Teichmiller, Vietnam Army Veteran and member of the Executive Board for the Legion, offered to fold the flag in the traditional triangle. Greg described the meaning behind the folding of the flag as representing the tri-cornered hat worn by the soldiers who served under George Washington. Greg has a wealth of knowledge about the history of the American Legion and Veteran activities in the area.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The flag and certificate are now proudly displayed in the front entryway at Heartland’s office.&nbsp; It serves as a reminder that Heartland Hospice is truly honored to care for Veterans and their families.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n                </div>\n            </div>        </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n                </div>\n    </div>\n\n\n\t                  <a class=\"close-icon popup_veteran-4_close\">\n\t                    <img src=\"/css/images/x-close-navy.svg\" alt=\"close-icon\">\n\t                </a>\n\t            "

The music therapist stated, ‘I just finished a singalong video for the VA in Manteno to be live-streamed on their closed-circuit TV channel later this week.’ This is just one of the many ways that she can still reach people at a time such as this.”</p>\n<p>“Our spiritual counselors have been finding that families desire to be supported during this challenging pandemic, even if it is via telephone. ‘By providing empathy, prayer, spiritual direction and condolences when necessary, families have not only expressed gratitude for my services but also a sense of relief and spirit of hope,’ stated one spiritual counselor. Another one of our spiritual counselors stated, ‘Our families seem happy to have someone to talk with and we are lifelines of information for people.’”</p>\n<p>“Our social workers have found that families are really open to talking with us because of the extra time that they have on their hands, since their lives have slowed down. One of our social workers stated, ‘I attempt to engage in conversations outside of the current pandemic. Families are sharing current projects that they are working on, ideas for self-care and they also have been encouraging me to do the same.’ This strongly shows that even though we are the professionals, we are learning something new every single day. And you, as a family member or friend, are the one that is in the driver’s seat of our care. You teach us as much as we teach you!”</p>\n<p>“Our volunteer coordinator is working with our phenomenal volunteers to work as team to help not only our patients and families but our staff as well. They are making blankets for our patients to be comfortable at end-of -life and making masks so that we can continue staying healthy for everyone we encounter. She stated, ‘All of the relationships that I have with event coordinators, volunteer fairs and conferences have been such a blessing because we are looking out for one another as well.’”</p>\n<p>“As you can see, even though we are a hospice company, we are so much more than that. We are people, just like you, who strive to make others feel comfortable at such a difficult time in their lives. We must care for ourselves so we can care the best for you and your loved ones. We have resilience in the face of fear. We work together to make sure that no matter what restrictions are put on us, we will be creative and we will meet your needs. We are Heartland Hospice.”</p>\n\n\n                </div>\n            </div>        </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n                </div>\n    </div>\n\n\n\t                  <a class=\"close-icon popup_wearehea1_close\">\n\t                    <img src=\"/css/images/x-close-navy.svg\" alt=\"close-icon\">\n\t                </a>\n\t            "

We Honor Veterans was launched by the National Hospice and Palliative Care Organization in collaboration with the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to help improve the care veterans receive from hospice and palliative care providers.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;“I know the importance of Heartland’s initiative to better serve these United States veterans,” commented Maureen Lewis, RN, Director of Professional Services. “I am a veteran myself, and I believe we not only care for the mind, body and spirit of our veterans, but that Heartland is a hospice provider trained to care specifically for veterans,” added Maureen. “The Heartland Hospice team is honored to care for our community’s veterans. It is a privilege to care for these men and women in their current struggles, just as they have cared for us and our country in the past,” said Cathy McBride, Administrator.</p>\n<p>The We Honor Veterans program provides four levels of recognition to organizations that demonstrate a commitment to improving care for veterans. In order to reach Level Four, Heartland was tasked with learning more about caring for veterans, declaring a commitment to honoring veterans at the end of life, providing education for hospice staff and volunteers on caring for veterans and partnering with the VA at the local, regional and national level to ensure the unique needs of veterans are met.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Belinda O’Brien, Volunteer Coordinator, said, “I have a special place in my heart for veterans. My father was an Army veteran and served in the Korean War. He was very proud to serve his country.” “When a veteran patient begins receiving hospice care, we perform a bedside pinning ceremony to thank them for their service to our country. During the pinning, they are given a pin, a certificate and a homemade patriotic blanket. We also host various holiday celebrations for our veteran patients and the veterans in our community. It has been an honor to work towards achieving our stars with the We Honor Veterans program,” said Belinda.</p>\n<p>To learn more about the We Honor Veterans initiative, the steps that our agencies have taken to receive this acknowledgement or to see where other Heartland agencies are at in the process of achieving this honor, visit their <a href=\"http://www.wehonorveterans.org\" target=\"_blank\">website</a>.</p>\n\n\n                </div>\n            </div>        </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n                </div>\n    </div>\n\n\n\t                  <a class=\"close-icon popup_heartlan2_close\">\n\t                    <img src=\"/css/images/x-close-navy.svg\" alt=\"close-icon\">\n\t                </a>\n\t            "

As a Level 3 member, they provide all new veteran patients with a bedside pinning ceremony in the comfort of the patient’s home. They are also thanked with a certificate and a poem with a star that has been cut from an old American flag that has been retired. They also receive a homemade blanket.</p>\n<p>Blankets are donated by a variety of community organizations and volunteers. In any given year, Heartland may receive over 50 blankets. Recently, Heartland Volunteer Coordinator, Belinda O’Brien noticed that the blanket supply was getting low. Over lunch with her friend, Jennifer, when Belinda mentioned the low blanket supply, Jennifer had an immediate solution. As the leader of a local Girl Scout troop, her scouts would make fleece blankets with tied fringe borders to help replenish the supply.</p>\n<p>Jennifer saw this opportunity as a way to show not only the girls, but other people as well, the importance of recognizing the men and women who have made sacrifices for our freedoms. “I was hoping we were able to make the blankets because my husband is a veteran and my father-in-law was a veteran, so it’s kind of a subject that’s close to our hearts,” Jennifer said.</p>\n<p>Jennifer’s twin daughters, Jessica and Tina, are part of the Girl Scout troop and helped make the blankets. “I liked being able to help out the veterans and want them to know that people are thinking about them and care about them. I had fun making the camouflage blanket I picked out. It made me feel good that I was able to help,” Jessica said. “I really enjoyed this experience and love the Marines blanket I made. I hope the veterans understand that we all care about them and are thankful for everything they have done for us,” said Tina.</p>\n<p>A total of 32 blankets were made and donated to Heartland Hospice. This was the first donation of blankets with designs from all of the military branches on them.</p>\n\n\n                </div>\n            </div>        </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n                </div>\n    </div>\n\n\n\t                  <a class=\"close-icon popup_girlscou3_close\">\n\t                    <img src=\"/css/images/x-close-navy.svg\" alt=\"close-icon\">\n\t                </a>\n\t            "

Volunteers race against the clock to fly these veterans to Washington, DC to see the memorial constructed for them in 2004, nearly 60 years after their epic struggle. Many veterans say, with the exception of their wedding day and the birth of their children, the trip is the best day of their life.</p>\n<p>Lead by Volunteer Coordinator, Belinda O’Brien, the Heartland team worked to organize and promote the event to have the mandatory presale of 67 tickets. They even invited Mayor of Mokena, Frank Fleischer and his wife, Laurie, both of whom attended. On the night of the event with 81 community members in attendance, Boy Scout Troop 318 of Tinley Park presented the flag ceremony and lead the Pledge of Allegiance.</p>\n<p>Cathy McBride, Heartland Administrator, welcomed all and talked about Heartland Hospice’s partnership with the We Honor Veterans program. She also read a poem about freedom. “We asked all of the veterans in attendance to come to the front for a pinning ceremony to thank them publicly for their service and the sacrifices they made for our country and fellow Americans,” explained Cathy. “We also had staff in the audience pin any veterans who could not walk up to the stage,” she added.</p>\n<p>As everyone watched the movie, there were many tears in the audience, fortunately Heartland handed out tissues before the movie. At the end of the evening, the boy scouts retired the flags.</p>\n<p>“I have to say the best part of this event was hearing the stories from the veterans who were open to sharing,” commented Belinda. “I overheard a veteran talking to his grandson about being in Vietnam when he was a young man and all the friends he made and the many he lost. It was very touching!”</p>\n\n\n                </div>\n            </div>        </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n                </div>\n    </div>\n\n\n\t                  <a class=\"close-icon popup_heartlan4_close\">\n\t                    <img src=\"/css/images/x-close-navy.svg\" alt=\"close-icon\">\n\t                </a>\n\t            "

The wife was distraught and not very clear. I was asked to visit this patient and his family first before going to my other appointments.” &nbsp;</p>\n<p>When Tina arrived the patient was in pain, struggling to breath and very scared. She gave him his medicine and made him comfortable in his bed. “I told him that I would be with him as long as he needed me. I sat at his bedside at eye level and told him, <em>just look at me</em>,” explained Tina.</p>\n<p>Tina continued to talk quietly to the patient while holding his hand and keeping him calm. At one point, he spoke two words to her, “thank you.” His family later told Tina those were the first words he had spoken in the last few days. She never left his bedside and was with him as he took his last breath. Tina explains, “He comforted me just as much as I comforted him. He also reminded me that sometimes schedules and plans are not the most important part of my job.”</p>\n<p>“I firmly believe we are put exactly where we are meant to be and I was supposed to be there with him. Death is as much a part of life as being born. Someone transitioning deserves the same love and compassion as a new baby entering the world. This patient shared his last hours of life with me. That is truly the highest honor and privilege I could ever hope for,” added Tina.</p>\n\n\n                </div>\n            </div>        </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n                </div>\n    </div>\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t                </section>\n\t\t\t\t              <a class=\"close-icon popup_beingthe4_close\">\n\t\t\t\t                <img src=\"/css/images/x-close-navy.svg\" alt=\"close-icon\">\n\t\t\t\t            </a>\n\t\t\t\t        "

Josephine is 96 years old and is originally from England.

Shantae wanted to help Josephine with her Heart’s Desire and worked with Tana Benford, vice president of development and membership at the Toledo Zoo &amp; Aquarium, to make her wish come true. Tana was able to secure tickets for Josephine and her care team along with a special experience to feed the giraffes at Tower Ridge and a train ride on the Safari Railway.</p>\n<p>ProMedica Air and Mobile transported Josephine to the Toledo Zoo and she was greeted with a gift from Ismael Garza, security technician at the Toledo Zoo &amp; Aquarium. Ismael gave Josephine the VIP treatment taking her around the zoo to see all the animals and spoke with her about each animal she saw. “It’s always a pleasure to spend time with a visitor who loves the Zoo and the animals as much as we do,” shared Ismael.</p>\n<p>“It was a good day, I love animals and watching them is very interesting. The zoo is one of my favorite places,” said Josephine.</p>\n<p>Thank you to the ProMedica Hospice team, ProMedica Air and Mobile team, Tana, Ismael and all the employees at the Toledo Zoo who helped to make Josephine’s Heart’s Desire come true.</p>\n\n\n                </div>\n            </div>        </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n    <div>\n        <div class=\"container\">\n        <div class=\"row clearfix\">\n            <div class=\"span6 col\">\n                <div style=\"width: 100%;\">\n                            \n    \n    <img src=\"/media/11387/zoo-visit-6-from-jaimes-phone.jpg\" class=\"responsiveImg\">\n\n\n                </div>\n            </div>            <div class=\"span6 col\">\n                <div style=\"width: 100%;\">\n                            \n    \n    <img src=\"/media/11388/zoo-visit-7-from-jaimes-phone.jpg\" class=\"responsiveImg\">\n\n\n                </div>\n            </div>        </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n    <div>\n        <div class=\"container\">\n        <div class=\"row clearfix\">\n            <div class=\"span4 col\">\n                <div style=\"width: 100%;\">\n                            \n    \n    <img src=\"/media/11373/agency-pics-zoo-hearts-desire-2.jpg\" class=\"responsiveImg\">\n\n\n                </div>\n            </div>            <div class=\"span4 col\">\n                <div style=\"width: 100%;\">\n                            \n    \n    <img src=\"/media/11383/zoo-visit-2-from-mollys-phone.jpg\" class=\"responsiveImg\">\n\n\n                </div>\n            </div>            <div class=\"span4 col\">\n                <div style=\"width: 100%;\">\n                            \n    \n    <img src=\"/media/11378/agency-pics-zoo-hearts-desire-7.jpg\" class=\"responsiveImg\">\n\n\n                </div>\n            </div>        </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n                </div>\n    </div>\n\n\n\t                  <a class=\"close-icon popup_promedic1_close\">\n\t                    <img src=\"/css/images/x-close-navy.svg\" alt=\"close-icon\">\n\t                </a>\n\t            "

Erin’s House provides support for children, teens and families who have experienced a death. Kathryn McLaughlin, a grief counselor and school liaison for Erin’s House, explained the books are used in “Grief Backpacks” that will be distributed across the area to local schools. These backpacks help provide support through age-appropriate books to children of all ages dealing with the grief of a loved one. According to Kathryn, it was the most perfect time for this donation to come through. Now that Erin’s House does not have the extra cost of books for their school program, they were able to spend their funds on snacks, goodies and other materials for children that will help enrich the grief program.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n                </div>\n            </div>        </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n                </div>\n    </div>\n\n\n\t                  <a class=\"close-icon popup_promedic2_close\">\n\t                    <img src=\"/css/images/x-close-navy.svg\" alt=\"close-icon\">\n\t                </a>\n\t            "

My words were well-intentioned and came from a sincere place.</p>\n<p>This was until I met Jim. Jim was introduced to me as a Marine who served in the Korean War; more specifically, the Chosin Reservoir. I instinctively thanked Jim for his service.</p>\n<p>I was not familiar with this battle, the Chosin Reservoir. I did not remember learning about it in high school so long ago and I had never met someone who spoke about it. That night I looked up the Chosin Reservoir.&nbsp; I was in tears. My tears were not because of the insane conditions these men were fighting in—and against.&nbsp; My tears came from a place of embarrassment. I thanked Jim without knowing the true service and sacrifice he gave our country. At this point, my <em>thank you</em> felt empty. I had met someone who fought in one of the most savage battles in Marine Corp history. The next day, I was with Jim again and told him about my research the night before. I offered him an apology for my ignorance when I thanked him the day prior. I asked Jim if I could thank him appropriately. I explained that I had no idea of the battle he served in and thanked him for teaching me a very important lesson that I would remember when thanking Veterans in the future. We embraced and from that day began to develop a strong friendship.</p>\n<p>When Jim and I would meet, I learned a little more about him as a person, as a father, as a husband. I became friends with someone who served as a frontline machine gunner and a squad leader in 5 major battles, including the battle of the Chosin Reservoir. I learned that Jim was a recipient of several military decorations including the Purple Heart Medal for injuries he received on the battlefield. I learned about Jim’s story.</p>\n<p>Those who served in the military have his or her own story surrounding time in service and individual sacrifices were made. Not all stories are the same and not every person has the same experience. The story <em>matters</em> and the individual Veteran <em>matters</em>.</p>\n<p>My lesson: Give <em>intention</em> to my thank you. Before I thank an individual Veteran for his or her service, I ask questions so that I may offer an informed thank you. Some questions I ask: What branch did you serve? When did you serve? How long did you serve? What was your job while serving?</p>\n<p>Nowadays, I am not thanking a Veteran…I am thanking a 'Jim' who enlisted at age 17 and served four years (1948-1952) in the Marine Corp as a machine gunner in the battle of the Chosin Reservoir in the Korean War.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n                </div>\n            </div>        </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n                </div>\n    </div>\n\n\n\t                  <a class=\"close-icon popup_eachindi1_close\">\n\t                    <img src=\"/css/images/x-close-navy.svg\" alt=\"close-icon\">\n\t                </a>\n\t            "

Chris spent more than 4 years on active duty in the Army's 3rd Infantry Division at Fort Stewart, Georgia.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>According to Amanda Cottrell, Heartland Hospice serving Central Wisconsin volunteer coordinator, Chris reached out last October after seeing Heartland’s Veteran-to-Veteran volunteer opportunity listed on the Marshfield United Way website. “Chris was very interested in wanting to make a difference in veterans’ lives, especially during the pandemic, and said he would commit to our volunteer program,” Amanda said. “He is very open to talking about his military experience and we could see he would be a great match with our Marshfield area veteran patients,” she said.</p>\n<p>COVID-19 restrictions derailed Chris’s volunteer service plans for many months since many hospice patients could not receive visitors. “We wanted to utilize his skills in a new way while we waited for restrictions to be lifted,” Amanda said. In addition to spending time helping with yard work for one of Heartland’s hospice patients, Chris took on a significant project – making a directory of all Wisconsin war memorials to share with Heartland employees, patients and families. “I enjoy knowing it may help more people visit them. At the very least, it helps bring to light that they exist!”</p>\n<p>Through his work on the project, Chris was surprised at just how many war memorials Wisconsin has. “They are everywhere!” he said. “The memorials are found in cemeteries, town halls, highways, parks, American Legion halls, airports, courthouses and street intersections.” “One of my favorite memorials to visit is the High Ground in Neillsville.” Chris said he has a personal connection to High Ground because he used to visit there with his grandparents and now enjoys the memorial with his children. “The statues, tributes and effigy mound are so beautiful, and there is something magical there,” he said.&nbsp; Chris wants the community to know that the High Ground is constantly working to help bring awareness to veterans and are always adding new projects to the site. “The little store there has a museum. I always love taking my kids in there.”</p>\n<p>Together with their prevalence throughout Wisconsin, Chris wants people to realize what impactful history lessons the memorials can offer. “I want people to take a minute to read the plaques at the memorials. There is so much history regarding the brave men and women who oftentimes gave their lives fighting for our country.”</p>\n<p>With the Wisconsin Veterans Memorial directory project now complete, Chris is excited about getting back to volunteer visits with hospice patients. “Now that volunteer restrictions are lifting in people’s homes and in facilities, Chris will start visiting with veterans who are lonely and wanting someone to visit with,” said Amanda.&nbsp; “Veteran-to-veteran visits can often spark powerful conversations and lead to great emotional and spiritual healing.”</p>\n<p>“I really enjoy visiting with veterans the most, but I also get to visit some people who have had amazing lives,” Chris said. He shared that the stories they tell are one of the things he likes most about being a volunteer for Heartland.&nbsp;“It also makes me happy to know that they have something to look forward to and enjoy having company.”</p>\n<p>To obtain a copy of the Wisconsin War Memorial directory compiled by Chris, please contact Amanda Cottrell at <a href=\"mailto:amanda.cottrell@promedica.org\">amanda.cottrell@promedica.org</a><span>.</span></p>\n\n\n                            \n    \n    <img src=\"/media/10543/chris-kids-cropped.jpg\" alt=\"Chris and his kids visiting a memorial\" class=\"responsiveImg\">\n        <p class=\"caption\">Chris and his kids visiting a memorial</p>\n\n\n                </div>\n            </div>        </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n                </div>\n    </div>\n\n\n\t                  <a class=\"close-icon popup_hospicev2_close\">\n\t                    <img src=\"/css/images/x-close-navy.svg\" alt=\"close-icon\">\n\t                </a>\n\t            "

During the meeting, he also presented Dori Sterkenburg, account liaison, with a certificate of appreciation for her outstanding service and assistance as a community partner. “Partnering with Post 63 gives me the opportunity to speak with community-minded veterans who are passionate about being involved,” Dori said. “It also allows me to share more about how Heartland serves veterans through our involvement in the National Hospice and Palliative Care Organization’s We Honor Veterans (WHV) Program.”</p>\n<p>Dan shared that the mission of Post 63 aligns with that of the national organization – serving veterans and the community in need. “We have a focus on Americanizing programs for children and the community,” said Dan. “We provide transportation for veterans to doctor appointments along with other places they made need to travel. We also offer scholarships for college, bereavement for widows, attend fellow veterans’ funerals and provide Memorial Day and Veterans Day programs.” Dan is proud of the ways Post 63 has been able to live the mission of the Legion.</p>\n<p>For more information about The American Legion, <a rel=\"noopener\" href=\"https://www.legion.org/history\" target=\"_blank\">click here</a>.</p>\n<p>For more information about the Museum of Military History, <a rel=\"noopener\" href=\"https://www.museumofmilitaryhistory.com/event/american-legion-birthday/2022-03-15/\" target=\"_blank\">click here</a>.</p>\n\n\n                </div>\n            </div>        </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n                </div>\n    </div>\n\n\n\t                  <a class=\"close-icon popup_hospicet4_close\">\n\t                    <img src=\"/css/images/x-close-navy.svg\" alt=\"close-icon\">\n\t                </a>\n\t            "

She endured an extremely difficult life, but she navigated through with grace and humor. If you weren't one step ahead of her, she was about to 'get you' with a good-natured prank. And as much as she loved to laugh, she loved to love people even more. My nana welcomed every person with open arms, sweet tea and a Little Debbie treat. She loved and treated everyone just the same, whether they were homeless or the CEO of a huge corporation, words of affirmation and a little reminder that Jesus loves us. She didn't care what anyone thought, she knew the human touch was healing, and she was determined to heal you with a back scratch.</p>\n<p>Without Heartland Hospice, my family and I truly believe my nana's last days would have been vastly different. Heartland Hospice seemed to be hand-wrapped, tied with a bow, and presented to us by God. Their admission nurse, Ally, stayed with my aunt for hours at the hospital to determine if my nana could be safely transported from the hospital to her skilled nursing facility. Heartland's nurses monitored her, staved off exacerbations and were present when my nana needed quick medical attention. The facility was so impressed at the difference between my nana needed quick medical attention. The facility was so impressed at the difference between my nana receiving hospice vs. without the service. My nana was comfortable and calmer. My nana was able to do her favorite thing one last time - meet new friends. The very ones who had been taking care of her in the previous weeks. She was able to create a few new memories and make a lot of people laugh. Most importantly, she was able to verbalize that she would actually like to transition to her heavenly home from her earthly home. The nurse made sure we had everything we needed and knew exactly what to do for my nana. The peace of mind that Heartland offered was the most valuable gift I've been given in my entire adult life.</p>\n<p>Thanks to Heartland Hospice's persistent and present team, we were all made aware early the following day that we should gather to say our goodbyes. As members of our family trickled in the following hours to say their goodbyes, Heartland's nurses took care of us just as much as they took care of my grandmother. My nana passed peacefully on June 15th surrounded by love - from both my family and Heartland Hospice. Heartland made the following hours, days and now months seamless and peaceful. I cannot thank Heartland's team enough for the time they dedicated to not just my nana, but to me and my family. At my nana's funeral, I looked up and saw five faces from the Heartland team beaming at my with the sentiment, 'We have got your back,' and my heart melted. I felt pure, unconditional and unwavering love my from nana for 35 years. The kind of love you can count on and know is always going to be there. I felt that same kind of pure love from Heartland Hospice that day. And months later, they're still here for us.\"</p>\n\n\n                </div>\n            </div>        </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n    <div>\n        <div class=\"container\">\n        <div class=\"row clearfix\">\n            <div class=\"span12 col\">\n                <div style=\"width: 100%;\">\n                            \n    \n    <img src=\"/media/8901/1.jpg\" class=\"responsiveImg\">\n\n\n                </div>\n            </div>        </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n                </div>\n    </div>\n\n\n\t                  <a class=\"close-icon popup_granddau3_close\">\n\t                    <img src=\"/css/images/x-close-navy.svg\" alt=\"close-icon\">\n\t                </a>\n\t            "

Tribble III, affectionately known as “Van” by his family, who has a diagnosis of Parkinson’s disease, informed Carmella, Medical Social Worker at Heartland Hospice serving The Upstate, that he wanted to go home one more time. Carmella met with his family and together they planned a surprise party for his trip home to celebrate his 77<sup>th</sup> birthday.</p>\n<p>Mr. Tribble was pleasantly surprised upon his arrival home where he saw his family members who came from all over to celebrate his birthday. He had many family members in attendance including daughter Carrie and grand-daughter Carolina. There were also many Heartland Hospice team members that were able to attend. Mr. Tribble was over the moon with excitement seeing everyone to celebrate his birthday.</p>\n<p>Stories were shared about the amazing life Mr. Tribble has led. His daughter Carrie shared how her dad was born with a hearing loss and it wasn’t until he was 50 years old that he could hear the sound of birds. Afterwards, he began taking piano lessons and Carrie remembered his first recital during the Christmas holidays. Mr. Tribble was a master at needle point and some of his work took more than five years to complete. Some of his needle point pieces appeared in Architecture Digest Magazine. He was also an incredible master gardener and he would plant hundreds of lily bulbs. In 1989 his courtyard was featured in Southern Living.</p>\n\n\n                </div>\n            </div>        </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n    <div>\n        <div class=\"container\">\n        <div class=\"row clearfix\">\n            <div class=\"span6 col\">\n                <div style=\"width: 100%;\">\n                            \n    \n    <img src=\"/media/8435/1.jpg\" class=\"responsiveImg\">\n\n\n                </div>\n            </div>            <div class=\"span6 col\">\n                <div style=\"width: 100%;\">\n                            \n    \n    <img src=\"/media/8436/3.jpg\" class=\"responsiveImg\">\n\n\n                </div>\n            </div>        </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n                </div>\n    </div>\n\n\n\t                  <a class=\"close-icon popup_heartlan4_close\">\n\t                    <img src=\"/css/images/x-close-navy.svg\" alt=\"close-icon\">\n\t                </a>\n\t            "

Our veterans are deserving of my undying support and gratitude. Semper Fi to each one of them. I hold firm to the conviction that my oath of enlistment will never expire,” said Mike.</p>\n<p>The We Honor Veterans program provides four levels of recognition to organizations that demonstrate a commitment to improving care for veterans. In order to reach Level Four, Heartland was tasked with learning more about caring for veterans, declaring a commitment to honoring veterans at the end of life, providing education for hospice staff and volunteers on caring for veterans and partnering with the VA at the local, regional and national level to ensure the unique needs of veterans are met.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>To learn more about the We Honor Veterans initiative, the steps that our agencies have taken to receive this acknowledgement or to see where other Heartland agencies are at in the process of achieving this honor, visit the <a rel=\"noopener\" href=\"http://www.wehonorveterans.org\" target=\"_blank\">We Honor Veterans website</a>.</p>\n\n\n                </div>\n            </div>        </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n                </div>\n    </div>\n\n\n\t                  <a class=\"close-icon popup_heartlan2_close\">\n\t                    <img src=\"/css/images/x-close-navy.svg\" alt=\"close-icon\">\n\t                </a>\n\t            "

Level Five is the highest level We Honor Veterans partners can attain and includes several new required activities and yearly recertification. “I am honored to work with such a dedicated organization that truly appreciates the sacrifices that our veterans have made for this great country! I am so proud to have achieved the Level Five partnership and I am looking forward to continuing to honor and support our veterans!” said Patrick Fisher, volunteer coordinator.</p>\n<p>All wars are different and provide unique experiences and often difficulties for the Veterans who served in them. We Honor Veterans was launched by the National Hospice and Palliative Care Organization in collaboration with the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to help improve the care veterans receive from hospice and palliative care providers.</p>\n<p>“As a veteran myself, I am proud that our team is here to honor veterans in any way that we can with all the services we have to offer. I am PROUD to be part of this team,” said Charles Schaller, retired Air Force veteran and ProMedica Hospice chaplain. Amanda Walton, bereavement/volunteer coordinator and Army National Guard veteran, added, “I am honored to work with such a dedicated organization. ProMedica is more than just hospice and end-of-life comfort. We know the sacrifices our veterans have made for this great country, and we try to show recognition daily. Achieving the Level Five partnership was a long year of a wonderful collaboration. All the teams really came together to show their support for our veteran community. We took it to heart to want to help heal unseen wounds of battles long ago, but not forgotten. It was a long but rewarding journey that we are fortunate enough to continue. It is difficult to truly express the gratitude we have for our veterans and all that they have done. But… that will not stop us from striving.”</p>\n<p>The We Honor Veterans program provides five levels of recognition to organizations that demonstrate a commitment to improving care for veterans. Aside from existing partner requirements, Level Five partners place a greater emphasis on staff education and caring for Vietnam-era and combat Veterans. Additionally, Level Five partners take on the role of regional mentor to other We Honor Veterans partners working to enhance their programs.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“When we set out to create the Level Five program we knew that it had to be different to truly showcase the efforts needed to go above and beyond. Not only has the Heartland Hospice team demonstrated their commitment, but they have helped shape the program and have continued as an example of what all hospice partners should strive to be,” said NHPCO President &amp; CEO Edo Banach.</p>\n<p>To learn more about the We Honor Veterans initiative, the steps that our agencies have taken to receive this acknowledgment or to see where our other agencies are at in the process of achieving this honor, visit the <a rel=\"noopener\" href=\"http://www.wehonorveterans.org\" target=\"_blank\">We Honor Veterans website</a>.</p>\n\n\n                </div>\n            </div>        </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n                </div>\n    </div>\n\n\n\t                  <a class=\"close-icon popup_promedic1_close\">\n\t                    <img src=\"/css/images/x-close-navy.svg\" alt=\"close-icon\">\n\t                </a>\n\t            "

Debbie Howarth, daughter of the patient, entrusted Heartland with the flannel shirt and field jacket that belonged to her father as he fondly wore his field jacket from his days in Vietnam. Debra explained that her sons got to know their Grandpap more during his final days and loved to hear his stories about Vietnam, developing an interest in that era. The bears were presents to her sons.</p>\n<p>“At first, I was reluctant to cut up the Marine shirt because I knew how much it meant to the family,” recounts Heartland Volunteer, Angela also the creator of the bears. She added, “Memories of war and the Vietnam era are sacred to all who served.”</p>\n<p>“It was a good feeling to be able to do something meaningful for the family of a serviceman. It was the first time anyone gave me a shirt that obviously was so important to the entire family,” she added. Angela had to improvise to make two bears from the plaid shirt.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>When Angela took the plaid shirt apart, she found 2 deposit slips in the pocket along with a toothpick. She decided to include them in a pocket of one of the bears. She used the field jacket to create vests for the bears. Once the bears were completed Angela took pictures of them. She explains, “I was proud of the way the bears turned out. I felt so much love and joy as I was completing this project. I hope the family always treasures their bears and passes on any stories they heard from their Grandpap.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n                </div>\n            </div>        </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n                </div>\n    </div>\n\n\n\t                  <a class=\"close-icon popup_heartlan2_close\">\n\t                    <img src=\"/css/images/x-close-navy.svg\" alt=\"close-icon\">\n\t                </a>\n\t            "

We Honor Veterans was launched by the National Hospice and Palliative Care Organization in collaboration with the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to help improve the care veterans receive from hospice and palliative care providers.</p>\n<p>“I am aware of the importance for our organization to want to serve our veterans until the end of life. As a veteran myself, I know there is a need to help my brothers and sisters during these difficult times. They deserve to feel the country they chose to serve still cares for them until the end of their journey,” added Jesus Rodriguez, Volunteer Coordinator.</p>\n<p>The We Honor Veterans program provides four levels of recognition to organizations that demonstrate a commitment to improving care for veterans. In order to reach Level Four, Heartland was tasked with learning more about caring for veterans, declaring a commitment to honoring veterans at the end of life, providing education for hospice staff and volunteers on caring for veterans and partnering with the VA at the local, regional and national level to ensure the unique needs of veterans are met.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>To learn more about the We Honor Veterans initiative, the steps that our agencies have taken to receive this acknowledgement or to see where other Heartland agencies are at in the process of achieving this honor, visit the <a rel=\"noopener\" href=\"http://www.wehonorveterans.org\" target=\"_blank\">We Honor Veterans website</a>.</p>\n\n\n                </div>\n            </div>        </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n                </div>\n    </div>\n\n\n\t                  <a class=\"close-icon popup_heartlan1_close\">\n\t                    <img src=\"/css/images/x-close-navy.svg\" alt=\"close-icon\">\n\t                </a>\n\t            "

Along with ProMedica’s volunteer coordinator, Scarlet O’Heran, their tour included eight memorials and attending the changing of the guard at Arlington National Cemetery.</p>\n<p>The memorials were all poignant works of art, and each brought the 85 veterans closer to the sacrifices of the past that are still being felt today. Ken, being a Vietnam Veteran, was as prepared as possible for the impact of the memorials, but the human element was truly the most emotional part of the day. From the moment Scarlet and Ken started their journey, the outpouring of gratitude for the sacrifice of his service was palpable. Large groups of supporters, individual servicemen, and police and fire departments all shared their thanks and gratitude with Ken and the other veterans. The most memorable honor was the “Welcome Home” gathering where Ken’s family stood with hundreds of others just to say, “Welcome home and thank you!”</p>\n<p>What a wonderful day of honor!

Level Five is the highest level We Honor Veterans partners can attain and includes several new required activities and yearly recertification.</p>\n<p>All wars are different and provide unique experiences and often difficulties for the Veterans who served in them. We Honor Veterans was launched by the National Hospice and Palliative Care Organization in collaboration with the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to help improve the care veterans receive from hospice and palliative care providers.</p>\n<p>“I know the importance of Heartland’s initiative to better serve these United States veterans,” commented Wade Huskey, Veteran Volunteer. “I am a veteran myself, and I believe we not only care for the mind, body and spirit of our veterans, but that Heartland is a hospice provider trained to care specifically for veterans,” added Huskey.</p>\n<p>The We Honor Veterans program provides five levels of recognition to organizations that demonstrate a commitment to improving care for veterans. Aside from existing partner requirements, Level Five partners place a greater emphasis on staff education and caring for Vietnam-era and combat Veterans. Additionally, Level Five partners take on the role of regional mentor to other We Honor Veterans partners working to enhance their programs.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“When we set out to create the Level Five program we knew that it had to be different to truly showcase the efforts needed to go above and beyond. Not only has the Heartland Hospice team demonstrated their commitment, but they have helped shape the program and have continued as an example of what all hospice partners should strive to be,” said NHPCO President &amp; CEO Edo Banach.</p>\n<p>To learn more about the We Honor Veterans initiative, the steps that our agencies have taken to receive this acknowledgement or to see where other Heartland agencies are at in the process of achieving this honor, visit the <a rel=\"noopener\" href=\"http://www.wehonorveterans.org\" target=\"_blank\">We Honor Veterans website</a>.</p>\n\n\n                </div>\n            </div>        </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n                </div>\n    </div>\n\n\n\t                  <a class=\"close-icon popup_heartlan3_close\">\n\t                    <img src=\"/css/images/x-close-navy.svg\" alt=\"close-icon\">\n\t                </a>\n\t            "

Bill quickly responded, “Get back&nbsp;on a Harley!”</p>\n<p>Bill is a Korean War Veteran who used to race&nbsp;motorcycles in Florida and Hawaii back in the 1960s. Now, he is mostly confined to a bed, but was able to get his one wish in late August. “When I told him that he was going to be able to ride outside, he cried. He could not believe we were doing this for him and he just kept asking, ‘Why?’” Mary Lou said.</p>\n<p>Bill counted down the days and the hours until he was able to take his ride. The local deputy police chief took a vacation day form work in order to help grant Bill’s wish and the Grandview police and about 25 other motorcyclists, many who were Vets themselves, were honored to accompany Bill for the ride.</p>\n<p>Other veterans and the community lined up along the sidewalk to salute Bill as he took off for his hour-long ride in the police chief’s sidecar. “When we saw his face as he was pulling away, he was grinning from ear to ear and giving us a thumbs up. It was worth all the hard work we did to put this together,” Mary Lou said.</p>\n<p>After the ride, there was a reception held where Bill was presented with a&nbsp;Korean War Vet motorcycle vest made especially for him. When Mary Lou asked Bill what his favorite part of the day was he replied, “Being able to feel the wind in my hair again.”</p>\n\n\n                </div>\n            </div>        </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n                </div>\n    </div>\n\n\n\t                  <a class=\"close-icon popup_honoring2_close\">\n\t                    <img src=\"/css/images/x-close-navy.svg\" alt=\"close-icon\">\n\t                </a>\n\t            "

My words were well-intentioned and came from a sincere place.</p>\n<p>This was until I met Jim. Jim was introduced to me as a Marine who served in the Korean War; more specifically, the Chosin Reservoir. I instinctively thanked Jim for his service.</p>\n<p>I was not familiar with this battle, the Chosin Reservoir. I did not remember learning about it in high school so long ago and I had never met someone who spoke about it. That night I looked up the Chosin Reservoir.&nbsp; I was in tears. My tears were not because of the insane conditions these men were fighting in—and against.&nbsp; My tears came from a place of embarrassment. I thanked Jim without knowing the true service and sacrifice he gave our country. At this point, my <em>thank you</em> felt empty. I had met someone who fought in one of the most savage battles in Marine Corp history. The next day, I was with Jim again and told him about my research the night before. I offered him an apology for my ignorance when I thanked him the day prior. I asked Jim if I could thank him appropriately. I explained that I had no idea of the battle he served in and thanked him for teaching me a very important lesson that I would remember when thanking Veterans in the future. We embraced and from that day began to develop a strong friendship.</p>\n<p>When Jim and I would meet, I learned a little more about him as a person, as a father, as a husband. I became friends with someone who served as a frontline machine gunner and a squad leader in 5 major battles, including the battle of the Chosin Reservoir. I learned that Jim was a recipient of several military decorations including the Purple Heart Medal for injuries he received on the battlefield. I learned about Jim’s story.</p>\n<p>Those who served in the military have his or her own story surrounding time in service and individual sacrifices were made. Not all stories are the same and not every person has the same experience. The story <em>matters</em> and the individual Veteran <em>matters</em>.</p>\n<p>My lesson: Give <em>intention</em> to my thank you. Before I thank an individual Veteran for his or her service, I ask questions so that I may offer an informed thank you. Some questions I ask: What branch did you serve? When did you serve? How long did you serve? What was your job while serving?</p>\n<p>Nowadays, I am not thanking a Veteran…I am thanking a 'Jim' who enlisted at age 17 and served four years (1948-1952) in the Marine Corp as a machine gunner in the battle of the Chosin Reservoir in the Korean War.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n                </div>\n            </div>        </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n                </div>\n    </div>\n\n\n\t                  <a class=\"close-icon popup_eachindi1_close\">\n\t                    <img src=\"/css/images/x-close-navy.svg\" alt=\"close-icon\">\n\t                </a>\n\t            "

We depend on our hospice volunteers to help us provide the love, respect and care our patients and their families need. Our volunteers are the heart of Heartland.</p>\n<p>Heartland Hospice serving Middle Georgia has a wonderful group of dedicated volunteers ranging anywhere from 14-80 years old and serve as veteran volunteers, volunteering with their animals for pet visits and everything in between. Yolanda, a dedicated Heartland volunteer, has helped numerous patients and families in many ways over the past two years.</p>\n<p>Upon moving to Georgia from California, Yolanda began as a patient visitor and office volunteer. Due to restrictions from the pandemic, she has persevered and continues volunteering in unique ways. Yolanda resides in a senior living facility that cares very much about the health of their residents. Therefore, there have been strict protocols in place since late February. No visitors are allowed inside, and residents are only allowed to leave the facility for very essential reasons.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Yolanda’s heart longed to still give back to the people of Heartland. After only a short period, she decided to continue volunteering with small tasks that could be dropped off and picked up at her facility in a safe way while maintaining social distancing guidelines. She started with making beautiful cards to send to every Heartland patient. Recently, she started making beautiful handmade crafts to bring cheer not only to Heartland’s patients, but also the staff. Her most recent craft was hand-painting and designing almost 100 birdhouses.</p>\n<p>Yolanda said, “Throughout my whole life, I have always enjoyed helping others. My need to serve is the core of my being. In addition, praying always connects me to the Holy Spirit for guidance. When I first heard about the coronavirus, my heart was overwhelmed.” Volunteering has helped Yolanda continue to give back during these difficult times. “Volunteering gives me the opportunity to connect with others and be grateful for the life our Lord has given to us. Giving love fills my heart. I’m grateful to Heartland for allowing me to be of some help.”</p>\n<p>Especially during these difficult times, Heartland Hospice is always accepting new, caring volunteers.

My words were well-intentioned and came from a sincere place.</p>\n<p>This was until I met Jim. Jim was introduced to me as a Marine who served in the Korean War; more specifically, the Chosin Reservoir. I instinctively thanked Jim for his service.</p>\n<p>I was not familiar with this battle, the Chosin Reservoir. I did not remember learning about it in high school so long ago and I had never met someone who spoke about it. That night I looked up the Chosin Reservoir.&nbsp; I was in tears. My tears were not because of the insane conditions these men were fighting in—and against.&nbsp; My tears came from a place of embarrassment. I thanked Jim without knowing the true service and sacrifice he gave our country. At this point, my <em>thank you</em> felt empty. I had met someone who fought in one of the most savage battles in Marine Corp history. The next day, I was with Jim again and told him about my research the night before. I offered him an apology for my ignorance when I thanked him the day prior. I asked Jim if I could thank him appropriately. I explained that I had no idea of the battle he served in and thanked him for teaching me a very important lesson that I would remember when thanking Veterans in the future. We embraced and from that day began to develop a strong friendship.</p>\n<p>When Jim and I would meet, I learned a little more about him as a person, as a father, as a husband. I became friends with someone who served as a frontline machine gunner and a squad leader in 5 major battles, including the battle of the Chosin Reservoir. I learned that Jim was a recipient of several military decorations including the Purple Heart Medal for injuries he received on the battlefield. I learned about Jim’s story.</p>\n<p>Those who served in the military have his or her own story surrounding time in service and individual sacrifices were made. Not all stories are the same and not every person has the same experience. The story <em>matters</em> and the individual Veteran <em>matters</em>.</p>\n<p>My lesson: Give <em>intention</em> to my thank you. Before I thank an individual Veteran for his or her service, I ask questions so that I may offer an informed thank you. Some questions I ask: What branch did you serve? When did you serve? How long did you serve? What was your job while serving?</p>\n<p>Nowadays, I am not thanking a Veteran…I am thanking a 'Jim' who enlisted at age 17 and served four years (1948-1952) in the Marine Corp as a machine gunner in the battle of the Chosin Reservoir in the Korean War.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n                </div>\n            </div>        </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n                </div>\n    </div>\n\n\n\t                  <a class=\"close-icon popup_eachindi1_close\">\n\t                    <img src=\"/css/images/x-close-navy.svg\" alt=\"close-icon\">\n\t                </a>\n\t            "

Operation Ruck 22 is an event where participants march 22 kilometers around Lake Monona carrying 22 pounds each to raise awareness for Veteran suicide.

Operation Ruck 22 strives to bring that number to zero.</p>\n<p>“I have never done anything of this magnitude and wanted to support Operation Ruck 22 and the mission,” Tracy stated. “I have lost a loved one from death by suicide and have friends who are at risk. Having participated in the Ruck was one way that I could raise awareness. The energy at the event was palpable and I am so happy to have been involved.”</p>\n\n\n                </div>\n            </div>        </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n                </div>\n    </div>\n\n\n\t                  <a class=\"close-icon popup_heartlan2_close\">\n\t                    <img src=\"/css/images/x-close-navy.svg\" alt=\"close-icon\">\n\t                </a>\n\t            "

To celebrate Veteran’s Day this year, we prepared vases of carnations and our volunteers made handmade ‘Thank You’ cards signed by the entire team.</p>\n<p>Due to many COVID-19 restrictions, we were limited to how we could deliver our gifts. Someone from the team was able to deliver the flowers during the week of Veteran’s Day along with a personalized certificate. Not only did our veteran patients receive these gifts, but our veteran team members and volunteers were also honored! We ensured that local facilities received pins of recognition for <em>all</em> veterans who reside in the facilities. Whenever we were able, our staff participated in pinning the veterans in those facilities. While the day might have looked different from previous years, we ensured our veterans were not forgotten!”</p>\n\n\n                </div>\n            </div>        </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n    <div>\n        <div class=\"container\">\n        <div class=\"row clearfix\">\n            <div class=\"span6 col\">\n                <div style=\"width: 100%;\">\n                            \n    \n    <img src=\"/media/9874/veterans-day-2020.jpg\" class=\"responsiveImg\">\n\n\n                </div>\n            </div>            <div class=\"span6 col\">\n                <div style=\"width: 100%;\">\n                            \n    \n    <img src=\"/media/9870/veterans-day-2020-4714-2.jpg\" class=\"responsiveImg\">\n\n\n                </div>\n            </div>        </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n                </div>\n    </div>\n\n\n\t                  <a class=\"close-icon popup_hospicet3_close\">\n\t                    <img src=\"/css/images/x-close-navy.svg\" alt=\"close-icon\">\n\t                </a>\n\t            "

I sat at his bedside at eye level and told him, <em>just look at me</em>,” explained Tina.</p>\n<p>Tina continued to talk quietly to the patient while holding his hand and keeping him calm. At one point, he spoke two words to her, “thank you.” His family later told Tina those were the first words he had spoken in the last few days. She never left his bedside and was with him as he took his last breath. Tina explains, “He comforted me just as much as I comforted him. He also reminded me that sometimes schedules and plans are not the most important part of my job.”</p>\n<p>“I firmly believe we are put exactly where we are meant to be and I was supposed to be there with him. Death is as much a part of life as being born. Someone transitioning deserves the same love and compassion as a new baby entering the world. This patient shared his last hours of life with me. That is truly the highest honor and privilege I could ever hope for,” added Tina.</p>\n\n\n                </div>\n            </div>        </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n                </div>\n    </div>\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t                </section>\n\t\t\t\t              <a class=\"close-icon popup_beingthe4_close\">\n\t\t\t\t                <img src=\"/css/images/x-close-navy.svg\" alt=\"close-icon\">\n\t\t\t\t            </a>\n\t\t\t\t        "

My deepest gratitude to the entire team at Heartland Hospice.\"</blockquote>\n    \n\n\n                            \n    \n<p><img id=\"__mcenew\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" src=\"/media/6020/caregiver-award.jpg?width=359&amp;height=478\" alt=\"\" width=\"359\" height=\"478\" rel=\"12038\" data-id=\"12038\"></p>\n\n\n                </div>\n            </div>        </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n                </div>\n    </div>\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t                </section>\n\t\t\t\t              <a class=\"close-icon popup_daughter1_close\">\n\t\t\t\t                <img src=\"/css/images/x-close-navy.svg\" alt=\"close-icon\">\n\t\t\t\t            </a>\n\t\t\t\t        "

I sat at his bedside at eye level and told him, <em>just look at me</em>,” explained Tina.</p>\n<p>Tina continued to talk quietly to the patient while holding his hand and keeping him calm. At one point, he spoke two words to her, “thank you.” His family later told Tina those were the first words he had spoken in the last few days. She never left his bedside and was with him as he took his last breath. Tina explains, “He comforted me just as much as I comforted him. He also reminded me that sometimes schedules and plans are not the most important part of my job.”</p>\n<p>“I firmly believe we are put exactly where we are meant to be and I was supposed to be there with him. Death is as much a part of life as being born. Someone transitioning deserves the same love and compassion as a new baby entering the world. This patient shared his last hours of life with me. That is truly the highest honor and privilege I could ever hope for,” added Tina.</p>\n\n\n                </div>\n            </div>        </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n                </div>\n    </div>\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t                </section>\n\t\t\t\t              <a class=\"close-icon popup_beingthe4_close\">\n\t\t\t\t                <img src=\"/css/images/x-close-navy.svg\" alt=\"close-icon\">\n\t\t\t\t            </a>\n\t\t\t\t        "

My words were well-intentioned and came from a sincere place.</p>\n<p>This was until I met Jim. Jim was introduced to me as a Marine who served in the Korean War; more specifically, the Chosin Reservoir. I instinctively thanked Jim for his service.</p>\n<p>I was not familiar with this battle, the Chosin Reservoir. I did not remember learning about it in high school so long ago and I had never met someone who spoke about it. That night I looked up the Chosin Reservoir.&nbsp; I was in tears. My tears were not because of the insane conditions these men were fighting in—and against.&nbsp; My tears came from a place of embarrassment. I thanked Jim without knowing the true service and sacrifice he gave our country. At this point, my <em>thank you</em> felt empty. I had met someone who fought in one of the most savage battles in Marine Corp history. The next day, I was with Jim again and told him about my research the night before. I offered him an apology for my ignorance when I thanked him the day prior. I asked Jim if I could thank him appropriately. I explained that I had no idea of the battle he served in and thanked him for teaching me a very important lesson that I would remember when thanking Veterans in the future. We embraced and from that day began to develop a strong friendship.</p>\n<p>When Jim and I would meet, I learned a little more about him as a person, as a father, as a husband. I became friends with someone who served as a frontline machine gunner and a squad leader in 5 major battles, including the battle of the Chosin Reservoir. I learned that Jim was a recipient of several military decorations including the Purple Heart Medal for injuries he received on the battlefield. I learned about Jim’s story.</p>\n<p>Those who served in the military have his or her own story surrounding time in service and individual sacrifices were made. Not all stories are the same and not every person has the same experience. The story <em>matters</em> and the individual Veteran <em>matters</em>.</p>\n<p>My lesson: Give <em>intention</em> to my thank you. Before I thank an individual Veteran for his or her service, I ask questions so that I may offer an informed thank you. Some questions I ask: What branch did you serve? When did you serve? How long did you serve? What was your job while serving?</p>\n<p>Nowadays, I am not thanking a Veteran…I am thanking a 'Jim' who enlisted at age 17 and served four years (1948-1952) in the Marine Corp as a machine gunner in the battle of the Chosin Reservoir in the Korean War.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n                </div>\n            </div>        </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n                </div>\n    </div>\n\n\n\t                  <a class=\"close-icon popup_eachindi1_close\">\n\t                    <img src=\"/css/images/x-close-navy.svg\" alt=\"close-icon\">\n\t                </a>\n\t            "

Heartland Hospice serving Southeastern Wisconsin joined in the spirit of honoring these ordinary heroes of the “greatest generation” for their sacrifice, service and national unity. Recently, WWII veteran and hospice patient, David Masters, was presented with a special recognition in appreciation for his military service.</p>\n<p>David served in the Army during WWII from August 19, 1943 – April 21, 1946 as a “T4” Sergeant Technician. David is humble when he recalls his duties during the war, stating, “I was proud of the guys I served with. I didn’t do much… I stayed in the captain’s jeep to run the radio.” However, his military honors tell a different story, which include the American Theater Campaign ribbon, the European–African–Middle Eastern Campaign Medal with two bronze stars, the Good Conduct Medal and the World War II Victory Medal.</p>\n<p>David is the only WWII veteran remaining at the senior care facility where he resides. Therefore, the employees were committed to going the extra mile when partnering with Heartland Hospice to present him with a Quilt of Honor. David was fortunate enough to participate in the Honor Flight a few years ago and the personalized posters from his homecoming, filled with loving messages of appreciation from family and caregivers, served as the backdrop for the quilt presentation.</p>\n<p>David was touched and became tearful upon receiving his quilt from the Heartland Hospice team. He was also eager to open the “mail call” envelope that was filled with cards and letters of thanks from local school students.</p>\n<p>It was a privilege for Heartland Hospice to honor and recognize a true American hero with a Quilt of Honor, which serves as a symbol of thanks and gratitude for our veterans’ service to our nation.</p>\n\n\n                </div>\n            </div>        </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n    <div>\n        <div class=\"container\">\n        <div class=\"row clearfix\">\n            <div class=\"span4 col\">\n                <div style=\"width: 100%;\">\n                            \n    \n    <img src=\"/media/10271/david-salute.jpg\" class=\"responsiveImg\">\n\n\n                </div>\n            </div>            <div class=\"span4 col\">\n                <div style=\"width: 100%;\">\n                            \n    \n    <img src=\"/media/10272/david-with-quilt-on-lap.jpg\" class=\"responsiveImg\">\n\n\n                </div>\n            </div>            <div class=\"span4 col\">\n                <div style=\"width: 100%;\">\n                            \n    \n    <img src=\"/media/10273/patriotic-background.jpg\" class=\"responsiveImg\">\n\n\n                </div>\n            </div>        </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n                </div>\n    </div>\n\n\n\t                  <a class=\"close-icon popup_hospicet3_close\">\n\t                    <img src=\"/css/images/x-close-navy.svg\" alt=\"close-icon\">\n\t                </a>\n\t            "

This sparked an idea among the team on what they could do to lift Chris’ spirits. Emilee High, care transition coordinator, reached out to the community’s well-known Elvis impersonator, Alan Graveen, and asked if he would do a surprise private performance for their patient. Alan, owner of ‘The Strictly Elvis Show’, did not hesitate to help Heartland and offered to visit the following week.</p>\n<p>The look on Chris’ face was priceless when he saw Elvis (Alan) and his Heartland care team at the door. After he got over the initial shock, Chris smiled, cried tears of joy and sang and danced along throughout Elvis’ performance. During the visit, Chris shared that his love of all things Elvis isn’t just music-related. He also used to be an Elvis impersonator when he was younger! He was eager to bring out his old photos to show everyone when he performed as ‘The King’. Chris also served as the DJ at social events put on by the Association for the Rights of Citizens with Handicaps, where he was recognized for his 25 years of services.</p>\n<p>When the day was over, Alan gave Chris an autographed silk scarf, a teddy bear, Hawaiian lei, wooden cross necklace and encouraging words – all of which hold a special significance among true Elvis fans. The Heartland care team knew they achieved their mission after seeing the sparkle back in Chris’ eyes. This was an unforgettable moment for everyone!</p>\n\n\n                            \n    \n    <img src=\"/media/10157/big-smile.jpg\" class=\"responsiveImg\">\n\n\n                </div>\n            </div>        </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n    <div>\n        <div class=\"container\">\n        <div class=\"row clearfix\">\n            <div class=\"span4 col\">\n                <div style=\"width: 100%;\">\n                            \n    \n    <img src=\"/media/10158/chris-as-elvis.jpg\" class=\"responsiveImg\">\n\n\n                </div>\n            </div>            <div class=\"span4 col\">\n                <div style=\"width: 100%;\">\n                            \n    \n    <img src=\"/media/10161/holding-elvis-belt.jpg\" class=\"responsiveImg\">\n\n\n                </div>\n            </div>            <div class=\"span4 col\">\n                <div style=\"width: 100%;\">\n                            \n    \n    <img src=\"/media/10162/receiving-lei-from-elvis.jpg\" class=\"responsiveImg\">\n\n\n                </div>\n            </div>        </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n                </div>\n    </div>\n\n\n\t                  <a class=\"close-icon popup_hospicet4_close\">\n\t                    <img src=\"/css/images/x-close-navy.svg\" alt=\"close-icon\">\n\t                </a>\n\t            "

The hospice team worked together to surprise Jude with his Heart’s Desire.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“I can’t put into words adequately the emotions that have filled me these past 24 hours.</p>\n<p>It all started around 4 pm yesterday as I was sitting on my couch, I looked out my window and noticed a red Camaro convertible parked in my driveway. At first, I did not think much about it, but when a group of people started to build, I knew something was going on, especially when I saw Tracy, my care transition nurse from Heartland Hospice. I met with Tracy and my team and she reminded me that when we first met she asked me if I had a wish list and I told her that I would love to ride in a sports car and have a really nice steak dinner. Well, that is what they arranged for me.</p>\n<p>I was completely blown away when I discovered they had planned a special day for me. I couldn’t believe NO ONE had leaked anything to me. My daughter Emma arrived all dressed up to join me. I was also surprised to see a former classmate of mine and a friend of Tracy’s, Jason, who would be my chauffeur for the night.</p>\n<p>With me riding shotgun and Emma in the back, we headed out. The ride was great with the wind blowing and the music booming, I felt on top of the world. Jason and I had great conversations about the past, as well as our love of photography. We drove to several places and even went back to the Fridley area where we grew up; it brought back some great memories.</p>\n<p>On our way to the next location, the ride was sweet, I just enjoyed taking in every second of it. I did not take any pictures, I just wanted to be in the moment. When we arrived in downtown Minneapolis, Emma said, ‘We are here!’ It was Murray’s Steak House! I have always wanted to try their Silver Butter Knife Steak. I now knew that my other wish was about to happen. Jason dropped us off at the door and was on his way. I am so grateful for Jason; words cannot express how I feel about everything he did!</p>\n<p>Emma and I checked in with the hostess, and when asked how many I assumed 2, but Emma told them 6. Well, again another surprise! We were seated in the back of the restaurant, my back was to the door so I couldn’t see anyone who came in, I’m sure Emma planned this as well to keep surprising me, she is so clever.</p>\n<p>After a few minutes, my brother Joe and sister Kris arrived, then my twin brother John came with his wife Jody. Once everyone arrived, Emma then instructed me to open the card that Tracy had given me at the start of my adventure. Once I opened the card, the tears began to fall.</p>\n<p>The meal, as you probably guessed, was amazing and we had an incredible time! While sitting at the table with all my loved ones and taking the day in, I thought, what else could I ask for? The answer was NOTHING!</p>\n<p>I want to thank everyone involved and assure you of my continued prayers for you. You all gave me a wonderful gift and I will be forever grateful.</p>\n<p>Yours in Christ Jesus, Jude”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n                </div>\n            </div>        </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n    <div>\n        <div class=\"container\">\n        <div class=\"row clearfix\">\n            <div class=\"span4 col\">\n                <div style=\"width: 100%;\">\n                            \n    \n    <img src=\"/media/11294/20200701_165048.jpg\" class=\"responsiveImg\">\n\n\n                </div>\n            </div>            <div class=\"span4 col\">\n                <div style=\"width: 100%;\">\n                            \n    \n    <img src=\"/media/11295/dinner.jpg\" class=\"responsiveImg\">\n\n\n                </div>\n            </div>            <div class=\"span4 col\">\n                <div style=\"width: 100%;\">\n                            \n    \n    <img src=\"/media/11293/20200701_164932.jpg\" class=\"responsiveImg\">\n\n\n                </div>\n            </div>        </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n                </div>\n    </div>\n\n\n\t                  <a class=\"close-icon popup_patientt1_close\">\n\t                    <img src=\"/css/images/x-close-navy.svg\" alt=\"close-icon\">\n\t                </a>\n\t            "

She signed up to volunteer in hopes of making a difference in the lives of others.&nbsp; What she didn't anticipate was the profound impact that being a volunteer and interacting with hospice patients and their loved ones would make in <em>her </em>life. One particular event she recently experienced with a patient, Cindy, and her husband, Tim, was one that Sue will never forget.</p>\n<p>“When Cindy turned sixty, she knew this would be her last birthday celebration, so she made a final wish: to surround herself with family and friends. Knowing her fondness for Elvis, Cindy’s brother agreed to play the part of the famous singer. Tim also had something special in mind. After forty years of marriage, he and Cindy, joined by their beloved dog, Dolly, would renew their wedding vows during the party.”</p>\n<p>“While Tim called and invited their family and friends, Karah, a Heartland Hospice Social Worker, quickly arranged the party details. Several other Heartland members eagerly joined in to help fulfill the wish. Spiritual Care Coordinator, Bob, would perform the vow renewal ceremony. Volunteer, Loriann, would play her keyboard and sing some of Cindy's favorite songs. I would curl and style Cindy's hair. Music therapist, Iansa, would play her guitar and sing hymns chosen by Cindy and Tim. With plans finalized, everyone was ready for the party.”</p>\n<p>“Too weak for me to curl her hair according to plan, Cindy lay peacefully on her bed in her sun-filled living room, nails freshly painted her favorite color, purple, the same color many guests wore in her honor. While Loriann's soothing music carried love throughout their home, friends and family continued to arrive, sharing hugs, thoughts, tears, and smiles. But most of all, sharing lots of love. And then in walked Elvis! Instantaneously, all faces wore smiles, but the biggest smile was Cindy's. She reached up as Elvis lowered his hug to meet hers.”</p>\n<p>“The time had arrived for the special ‘I do's.’ Bob officiated, delivering compassionate dignity, as Tim held Dolly and tenderly cradled Cindy's hand. Afterward, hugs flowed and so did more smiles and tears. There was also a silence that filled the room, as guests searched through their emotions, trying to find words to describe the honor and beauty they had just witnessed. Then, Iansa began singing and sharing copies of the hymns so all could join in tribute. Later, some words came to mind and were shared: love, honor, dignity, compassion, care, support, beautiful, moving, incredible, grateful, and thank you. Tim shared that someone mentioned this should be done instead of funerals. I agreed.”</p>\n<p>“Cindy and Tim's celebration changed my life. I have never witnessed such a beautiful display of love for one another and from one another. As I write this, now several weeks following Cindy's party and her passing, I am still trying to fully process the magnitude of Cindy's gift fulfilled. What I am certain of is the immense power love has when it is shared. I have to wonder if Cindy and Tim knew that their wishes for themselves would be so far-reaching. I couldn't be more grateful and thankful to Cindy and Tim for allowing me the privilege of sharing in their lives and in their love.”</p>\n\n\n                </div>\n            </div>        </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n                </div>\n    </div>\n\n\n\t                  <a class=\"close-icon popup_abirthda3_close\">\n\t                    <img src=\"/css/images/x-close-navy.svg\" alt=\"close-icon\">\n\t                </a>\n\t            "

I sat at his bedside at eye level and told him, <em>just look at me</em>,” explained Tina.</p>\n<p>Tina continued to talk quietly to the patient while holding his hand and keeping him calm. At one point, he spoke two words to her, “thank you.” His family later told Tina those were the first words he had spoken in the last few days. She never left his bedside and was with him as he took his last breath. Tina explains, “He comforted me just as much as I comforted him. He also reminded me that sometimes schedules and plans are not the most important part of my job.”</p>\n<p>“I firmly believe we are put exactly where we are meant to be and I was supposed to be there with him. Death is as much a part of life as being born. Someone transitioning deserves the same love and compassion as a new baby entering the world. This patient shared his last hours of life with me. That is truly the highest honor and privilege I could ever hope for,” added Tina.</p>\n\n\n                </div>\n            </div>        </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n                </div>\n    </div>\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t                </section>\n\t\t\t\t              <a class=\"close-icon popup_beingthe4_close\">\n\t\t\t\t                <img src=\"/css/images/x-close-navy.svg\" alt=\"close-icon\">\n\t\t\t\t            </a>\n\t\t\t\t        "

Many say they don’t have the words to describe their appreciation and simply say “Thanks.” Recently, Heartland Hospice Serving the Grand Strand recently received a thank you letter from the daughter of a patient expressing her gratitude for the wonderful care her father received.</p>\n<p><em>\"I would like to take this opportunity to express, on behalf of my father, Edward, and myself, our sincere appreciation for the assistance provided by Ashlee Scarborough, RN, in Myrtle Beach. Heartland Hospice serving The Grand Strand, a division of ProMedica, was recommended to my father since he lives alone and is in need of assistance. Ashlee went out of her way to quickly introduce herself and Heartland Hospice to him. Her in-person introduction was professional, personable, warm and inviting which put my father at ease with this new stage of his health care. She made him aware of the many ways that Heartland Hospice can provide assistance.</em></p>\n<p><em>This personal touch and contact by Ashlee was greatly appreciated by not only my father, but also by myself. I live over three hours away and to have someone we feel comfortable with assisting him with his needs is a blessing. She took time to explain the various services available to us in a clear and easy to understand way. She was willing to review and repeat information for my father as needed and did so with great patience. She was forced on answering all of our questions and providing us with the necessary information we needed to have Heartland Hospice as a partner in his care.</em></p>\n<p><em>Ashlee is always willing to do whatever it takes to get the job done and provide that added level of professional support. One such example is when she took the time to wait at the doctor's office for them to work up the orders necessary for my dad's assistance through the program. I cannot begin to tell you how much that was appreciated, especially since I could not be there myself for a few more weeks. Her extra efforts allowed us to get the services with Heartland Hospice started in an expedited manner to address the assistance needs of my father.</em></p>\n<p><em>Working with Ashlee has been a joy and having her engaged in my father's care has provided me with a level of comfort and peace of mind. She took the time to understand his needs and knows when circumstances require a level of urgency.</em></p>\n<p><em>Please pass along our sincere appreciation for all that she has done and continues to do in providing care for my father.</em></p>\n<p><em>Sincerely, Angela\"</em></p>\n\n\n                </div>\n            </div>        </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n                </div>\n    </div>\n\n\n\t                  <a class=\"close-icon popup_daughter4_close\">\n\t                    <img src=\"/css/images/x-close-navy.svg\" alt=\"close-icon\">\n\t                </a>\n\t            "

We will help you get transportation in place for your anniversary luncheon.”</p>\n<p>Angela approached Jennifer Duke, Heartland Director of Professional Services, to see if she could reach out to medical transport for assistance. With the help of the Heartland Team, the Francis’ were transported to Outback for a very special 44<sup>th</sup> Anniversary luncheon. The team signed a card and delivered a bouquet of flowers to Anne and Bill.&nbsp; A photo of the couple was taken and framed for Anne and Bill.</p>\n<p>“This was a truly special day as the team was able to celebrate the 44<sup>th</sup> wedding anniversary with this beautiful family who we are so privileged to care for, and also remembering that it’s not about the last time but what we make of the present that really counts,” expressed Angela.</p>\n\n\n                </div>\n            </div>        </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n                </div>\n    </div>\n\n\n\t                  <a class=\"close-icon popup_heartlan1_close\">\n\t                    <img src=\"/css/images/x-close-navy.svg\" alt=\"close-icon\">\n\t                </a>\n\t            "

Paul Alston, Bereavement Coordinator, gave words of inspiration and announced the names of all 189 lives that were being celebrated during the memorial service. Heartland honored the families with songs including <em>Amazing Grace</em> which was played on a violin and <em>I’ll Fly Away</em> sung by Chaplain Dave Lekarczyk.

As such, the final moments are as varied as each patient – some are filled with laughter, others are accompanied with tears, and still others are surrounded by tradition or ceremony. For those of us who witness these events, however, there is one thing that remains constant – the honor one feels in being present and the privilege that comes with sharing intimate moments with those concerned as an earthly life comes to its end.”</p>\n<p>A picture of a heart is displayed in Heartland’s agency lobby with a caption that reads, “Ask us about the <em>hearts</em> we carry.” “We want people to know that each heart symbolizes a journey that can be hard to describe in words but, has imprinted itself in not only our <em>hearts</em> but our souls,” commented Angela.</p>\n\n\n                            \n    \n    <img src=\"/media/6780/heart-pin-clinical-team.jpg\" class=\"responsiveImg\">\n\n\n                </div>\n            </div>        </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n    <div>\n        <div class=\"container\">\n        <div class=\"row clearfix\">\n            <div class=\"span6 col\">\n                <div style=\"width: 100%;\">\n                            \n    \n    <img src=\"/media/6781/heart-pin-ty.jpg\" class=\"responsiveImg\">\n\n\n                </div>\n            </div>            <div class=\"span6 col\">\n                <div style=\"width: 100%;\">\n                            \n    \n    <img src=\"/media/6783/newport-news-heart-pin-painting.jpg\" class=\"responsiveImg\">\n\n\n                </div>\n            </div>        </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n                </div>\n    </div>\n\n\n\t                  <a class=\"close-icon popup_heartlan3_close\">\n\t                    <img src=\"/css/images/x-close-navy.svg\" alt=\"close-icon\">\n\t                </a>\n\t            "

That’s when the Heartland Hospice team went into action and put together a memorable heart’s desire for Walter.</p>\n<p>On the “big day,” a chauffeured limousine from Dynasty Limo arrived at the assisted living facility to pick up Walter and the hospice team consisting of: David Lekarczyk, Chaplain; Laverne Lide, RN Case Manager; Alyshia Musgrave, CNA; and Sabrina Sampson, Social Worker. In true celebrity-style, the limo driver pulled out a red carpet and helped the team transport Walter from the facility into the limo.

They even placed a sign outside of the Bistro front door that said, “Welcome Walter” which was in full&nbsp;view as Walter opened the limo door. More tears flowed during this grand welcome.</p>\n<p>Earlier during the planning process, Sandy told Angela that the movie theater had closed due to power outages but she promised with power restored that she was going to open the theater just for Walter and his hospice team. Sandy stated, “We want this to be a special day for Walter!”</p>\n<p>As they entered the theater, everyone was surprised to see that Sandy had planned a private showing of Walter’s favorite movie, <em>Dark Tower</em>, along with meals of their choice to eat during the show. Brian Maskland, Peninsula Movie Bistro team member, presented Walter with two movie posters of <em>Sci-fi Planet of the Apes</em> and <em>Kong</em>, to take back and display on the walls of his room.

The music therapist sang beautiful patriotic music while playing her guitar.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The hospice team was honored to perform pinning ceremonies and present certificates to each individual Veteran.&nbsp;In addition, they were given red, white and blue wristbands which were imprinted with “Thank You for Your Service”.&nbsp;The ceremony closed with the Bugler playing taps.&nbsp;After the ceremony, the Veterans and other residents and family members enjoyed cake.&nbsp;Thank you to all Veterans for their service and sacrifices they made for our country!</p>\n\n\n                </div>\n            </div>        </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n    <div>\n        <div class=\"container\">\n        <div class=\"row clearfix\">\n            <div class=\"span4 col\">\n                <div style=\"width: 100%;\">\n                            \n    \n    <img src=\"/media/11054/vet-photo-3.png\" class=\"responsiveImg\">\n\n\n                </div>\n            </div>            <div class=\"span4 col\">\n                <div style=\"width: 100%;\">\n                            \n    \n    <img src=\"/media/11055/vet-photo-4.jpg\" class=\"responsiveImg\">\n\n\n                </div>\n            </div>            <div class=\"span4 col\">\n                <div style=\"width: 100%;\">\n                            \n    \n    <img src=\"/media/11052/thank-you-bracelet.jpg\" class=\"responsiveImg\">\n\n\n                </div>\n            </div>        </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n                </div>\n    </div>\n\n\n\t                  <a class=\"close-icon popup_promedic2_close\">\n\t                    <img src=\"/css/images/x-close-navy.svg\" alt=\"close-icon\">\n\t                </a>\n\t            "

James spoke with Tara, Senior Administrator, about Thomas’s wish and she worked with the rest of the staff at Heartland Hospice to help make&nbsp;his last wish come true.</p>\n<p>Thomas was an avid fisherman and enjoyed fishing with a group of veterans back in his younger years. Tara, James and Salvatore, RN Case Manager, helped Thomas achieve his wish and planned the trip to Sea Isle City, NJ. On the day of the trip, Thomas was smiling from ear to ear and couldn’t thank everyone enough. Thomas's wife, along with his best friend, were there to see him off, while James and Salvatore joined him on the boat to fish.</p>\n<p>“It was exciting to watch his reaction when the boat sped up while going through the inlet, and as the sun came up that morning, we were greeted by a pod of dolphins. While we were fishing, Thomas talked continually about his past fishing trips” said James.</p>\n<p>“I was happy to help Thomas achieve his wish of being able to go out fishing one last time. The day was perfect; from the weather, to&nbsp;Thomas catching the first fish and being able to reel it in without any help. This experience with&nbsp;him&nbsp;has left a lasting impression and leaves me with pride in choosing hospice nursing as a profession,”&nbsp;Salvatore said.</p>\n<p>A couple of fish were caught and Thomas was very appreciative for the one last boat ride. He sat in a beau bay chair facing the ocean while heading back to the dock and was extremely content with his day. The Heartland Hospice team was honored to be able to make his last wish come true.</p>\n\n\n                </div>\n            </div>        </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n    <div>\n        <div class=\"container\">\n        <div class=\"row clearfix\">\n            <div class=\"span6 col\">\n                <div style=\"width: 100%;\">\n                </div>\n            </div>            <div class=\"span6 col\">\n                <div style=\"width: 100%;\">\n                </div>\n            </div>        </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n    <div>\n        <div class=\"container\">\n        <div class=\"row clearfix\">\n            <div class=\"span4 col\">\n                <div style=\"width: 100%;\">\n                            \n    \n    <img src=\"/media/7754/1.jpg\" class=\"responsiveImg\">\n\n\n                </div>\n            </div>            <div class=\"span8 col\">\n                <div style=\"width: 100%;\">\n                            \n    \n    <img src=\"/media/7755/4.jpg\" class=\"responsiveImg\">\n\n\n                </div>\n            </div>        </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n                </div>\n    </div>\n\n\n\t                  <a class=\"close-icon popup_heartlan4_close\">\n\t                    <img src=\"/css/images/x-close-navy.svg\" alt=\"close-icon\">\n\t                </a>\n\t            "

At one point, he spoke two words to her, “thank you.” His family later told Tina those were the first words he had spoken in the last few days. She never left his bedside and was with him as he took his last breath. Tina explains, “He comforted me just as much as I comforted him. He also reminded me that sometimes schedules and plans are not the most important part of my job.”</p>\n<p>“I firmly believe we are put exactly where we are meant to be and I was supposed to be there with him. Death is as much a part of life as being born. Someone transitioning deserves the same love and compassion as a new baby entering the world. This patient shared his last hours of life with me.

They were welcomed to the annual memorial service by Samantha Johns, Bereavement Coordinator, along with the hospice care team.</p>\n<p>Poetry, scripture and music was shared in the sun-filled lobby. Through the window, members could see trees just beginning to show their autumn colors. As a part of the event, there was a “tree” inside on which the bereaved could hang fabric leaves with the written the names of their deceased loved ones. Memorial stones engraved with “In Loving Memory” and the patients’ names were given to families to keep close to their hearts. Candles were lit during the service to light a way forward in this journey.</p>\n<p>Music and songs were provided by Laura Roman, Music Therapist, during the service. When she sang “You’ll Never Walk Alone” by Richard Rogers from the Broadway Musical <em>Carousel</em>, everyone joined in. “This song tells us that you have hope in your heart, no matter how bad the storm gets, you won’t be alone. At Heartland, we try and be that hope for the patients and their families,” said Samantha.</p>\n<p>“We want our patients’ families to come back to Heartland as a safe space and be able to talk about their feelings. A big part of hospice is making sure that the bereaved are supported and comforted. Coming together for a memorial is part of that,” Samantha said.</p>\n\n\n                </div>\n            </div>        </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n                </div>\n    </div>\n\n\n\t                  <a class=\"close-icon popup_heartlan4_close\">\n\t                    <img src=\"/css/images/x-close-navy.svg\" alt=\"close-icon\">\n\t                </a>\n\t            "

He is diagnosed with COPD and cannot be without oxygen. Even with his health declining, he always has a smile for everyone he meets. Over the years, Carl had many different occupations, from truck driving to the railroad. He enjoys being outdoors and watching cowboy shows on television.</p>\n<p>Carl does not have any family, but considers the staff at Edgewood Manor of Wellston as his close friends, especially Jessica Harrison, Edgewood Manor Admissions Director, and Holly Helmic, Heartland Hospice RN/Account Liaison. Carl was approached about a last wish and he stated that he has always loved westerns and it was his wish to have authentic cowboy clothes, especially boots with spurs and a real hat, and to go out for a nice steak.</p>\n<p>Michelle Manring, Heartland Hospice Volunteer Coordinator, and Holly Helmic discussed with Karen Cox, Heartland Hospice Social Worker, about applying for The Heartland Hospice Memorial Fund Grant to help fulfill Carl’s last wish. When the grant was approved, Stephanie Lanane, Heartland Hospice Account Liaison, went out and purchased the cowboy clothes Carl had selected.</p>\n<p>Carl was so surprised and grateful to the Heartland Hospice team and the Heartland Hospice Memorial Fund for granting his last wish. As the day approached for his nice steak meal, Jessica, Holly, Karen and Stephanie took Carl to Rowdy’s Smokehouse, a local Western themed restaurant in Jackson, OH. The Rowdy’s Smokehouse Manager had reserved a special seat for Carl and his friends. Carl had a wonderful time out on the town, in his new cowboy clothes and spending time with his friends. He ate his steak and enjoyed a cup of coffee. Diners in the restaurant gave Carl a loving goodbye as he left.</p>\n<p>Carl expressed his gratitude and has since told many of his friends at Edgewood Manor about his night out and his new clothes. “It was wonderful to do this for Carl, it was an honor. We had so much fun! Carl is a very special patient and man,” said Holly. “Carl had been looking forward to his night out in his cowboy gear, it was so great to see him so happy and to get his wish fulfilled,” said Stephanie. “This really made Carl happy and it helped him to feel loved and cared for. Giving him his wish and being a part of his joy is what Hospice is all about,” said Karen.</p>\n<p>“This is why we, as a facility, love working with Heartland Hospice. The things they do for their patients goes above and beyond. Working with Karen Cox, Holly Helmic and Stephanie Lanane had been such a great experience, and to do the Wish Grant for Carl meant the world to him,” said Jessica.</p>\n<p>The Heartland Memorial Fund made this cowboy’s dreams come true!</p>\n\n\n                </div>\n            </div>        </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n    <div>\n        <div class=\"container\">\n        <div class=\"row clearfix\">\n            <div class=\"span6 col\">\n                <div style=\"width: 100%;\">\n                            \n    \n    <img src=\"/media/8684/fb_img_1562604643845.jpg\" class=\"responsiveImg\">\n\n\n                </div>\n            </div>            <div class=\"span6 col\">\n                <div style=\"width: 100%;\">\n                            \n    \n    <img src=\"/media/8685/fb_img_1562604653147.jpg\" class=\"responsiveImg\">\n\n\n                </div>\n            </div>        </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n    <div>\n        <div class=\"container\">\n        <div class=\"row clearfix\">\n            <div class=\"span12 col\">\n                <div style=\"width: 100%;\">\n                            \n    \n    <img src=\"/media/8682/fb_img_1562604617073.jpg\" class=\"responsiveImg\">\n\n\n                </div>\n            </div>        </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n                </div>\n    </div>\n\n\n\t                  <a class=\"close-icon popup_heartlan1_close\">\n\t                    <img src=\"/css/images/x-close-navy.svg\" alt=\"close-icon\">\n\t                </a>\n\t            "

Watching races on television was a family affair for Joan and her two sons. “I remember mom proudly wearing a leather Earnhardt Sr. hat on race days,” commented her son, Chris. When Joan’s son, Michael passed away at the age of 33 from cystic fibrosis, he was buried with a great deal of Earnhardt Sr. memorabilia.</p>\n<p>“I’ve been a Dale Jr. fan from the very beginning,” Joan proudly stated. After Earnhardt Sr.’s sudden passing, she started watching Dale Jr. as he followed in his father’s footsteps. When asked why she was a Dale Jr. fan, Joan quickly commented, “He’s a sexy fella and a damn good driver! He is also just an all-around good person.”</p>\n<p>After battling several illnesses and overall declining health, Joan was no longer able to live by herself. Chris, her only living son, moved in to help take care of her. It was also at this time that Joan was referred to Heartland Hospice. Every day, Joan would ask if any races were on and basically watch anything NASCAR. Knowing Joan’s love of all things NASCAR, Julie was surprised to learn that Joan had never attended a race. That’s when the Heartland team rallied together to get Joan to the races and to meet Dale Jr.!</p>\n<p>After several phone calls and emails, arrangements were made for Joan, Chris and Jacinda Brown, RN Heartland Liaison, to attend the Quaker State 400 at the Kentucky Speedway and to meet Dale Jr. and his team. Prior to the big day, Jacinda arranged for some pampering for Joan as she received a new haircut, her first “mani/pedi”, &nbsp;a new outfit for race day and a special dinner. “I saw a marked improvement in Joan’s attitude as she looked forward to attending the race,” said Jacinda. “It was important to me that Joan receive her wish because she has suffered great losses in her life,” she added.</p>\n<p>On race day, Joan and Chris met Dale Jr. and his team. They were also given access to the pits at trackside to see his car. Chris was able to get Dale Jr’s autograph for his mom. “Meeting Dale Jr. was an incredibly exciting experience for my mom,” stated Chris. “She couldn’t believe that Heartland set it up for her. It was one of the best days of her life,” he added.</p>\n<p><img id=\"__mcenew\" src=\"/media/6667/portsmouth-dale-jr-3.jpg?width=670&amp;height=922\" alt=\"\" width=\"670\" height=\"922\" rel=\"13203\" data-id=\"13203\"></p>\n<p><img id=\"__mcenew\" style=\"float: left;\" src=\"/media/6668/portsmouth-dale-jr-2.jpg?width=567&amp;height=907\" alt=\"\" width=\"567\" height=\"907\" rel=\"13204\" data-id=\"13204\"></p>\n\n\n                </div>\n            </div>        </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n                </div>\n    </div>\n\n\n\t                  <a class=\"close-icon popup_heartlan2_close\">\n\t                    <img src=\"/css/images/x-close-navy.svg\" alt=\"close-icon\">\n\t                </a>\n\t            "

She shared that three years ago she reconnected with her love, Terry, and both are originally from Pennsylvania.</p>\n<p>After their visit, Kristin jumped into action and began planning a memorable celebration of love for Wendy and Terry.

We're here for the families and friends of our patients, too. Whether it’s to have a safe space to share feelings or to remember the memory of loved ones. Heartland Hospice serving Raleigh-Durham was faced with challenges this year when it came to planning their annual memorial service. However, instead of the typical in-person service that is held each year, the team was able to plan several events that ensured the participants would stay safe. Kristin Lassiter, bereavement coordinator, tells about the drive-thru events:</p>\n<p>“2020 has taken the wind from our sails in many ways, but it cannot take our memories! Instead of our typical memorial service, this year found us in various parking lots offering family and friends a chance to <strong><em>remember</em></strong>. We celebrated lives of those whom we greatly miss. We held four drive-thru memorial services at different locations to make it as convenient as possible for family members. We had about 150 people attend who represented about 75 loved ones during the four events.</p>\n<p>We asked them to bring a ribbon to represent their loved one. Some were written on with marker and some were even embroidered. The family members hung their ribbons on the memorial display and before they left, we gave them a small glass sailboat candle holder and a poem to help them remember their loved one.</p>\n<p>We are so thankful to those who joined us and took time to honor the memory of the person they love. We felt honored hearing the thoughts and stories shared about each loved one and we recognize the privilege of being included in the grief journey of our patients’ families.</p>\n<p>We hope that those who attended were blessed with memories of their loved ones. It was great to see the smiles brought to their faces while sharing stories, even if there were also a few tears.”</p>\n\n\n                </div>\n            </div>        </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n    <div>\n        <div class=\"container\">\n        <div class=\"row clearfix\">\n            <div class=\"span4 col\">\n                <div style=\"width: 100%;\">\n                            \n    \n    <img src=\"/media/9939/1.jpg\" class=\"responsiveImg\">\n\n\n                </div>\n            </div>            <div class=\"span4 col\">\n                <div style=\"width: 100%;\">\n                            \n    \n    <img src=\"/media/9943/5.jpg\" class=\"responsiveImg\">\n\n\n                </div>\n            </div>            <div class=\"span4 col\">\n                <div style=\"width: 100%;\">\n                            \n    \n    <img src=\"/media/9946/8.jpg\" class=\"responsiveImg\">\n\n\n                </div>\n            </div>        </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n    <div>\n        <div class=\"container\">\n        <div class=\"row clearfix\">\n            <div class=\"span4 col\">\n                <div style=\"width: 100%;\">\n                            \n    \n    <img src=\"/media/9941/3.jpg\" class=\"responsiveImg\">\n\n\n                </div>\n            </div>            <div class=\"span4 col\">\n                <div style=\"width: 100%;\">\n                            \n    \n    <img src=\"/media/9942/4.jpg\" class=\"responsiveImg\">\n\n\n                </div>\n            </div>            <div class=\"span4 col\">\n                <div style=\"width: 100%;\">\n                            \n    \n    <img src=\"/media/9940/2.jpg\" class=\"responsiveImg\">\n\n\n                </div>\n            </div>        </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n    <div>\n        <div class=\"container\">\n        <div class=\"row clearfix\">\n            <div class=\"span4 col\">\n                <div style=\"width: 100%;\">\n                            \n    \n    <img src=\"/media/9947/9.jpg\" class=\"responsiveImg\">\n\n\n                </div>\n            </div>            <div class=\"span4 col\">\n                <div style=\"width: 100%;\">\n                            \n    \n    <img src=\"/media/9948/10.jpg\" class=\"responsiveImg\">\n\n\n                </div>\n            </div>            <div class=\"span4 col\">\n                <div style=\"width: 100%;\">\n                            \n    \n    <img src=\"/media/9949/11.jpg\" class=\"responsiveImg\">\n\n\n                </div>\n            </div>        </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n                </div>\n    </div>\n\n\n\t                  <a class=\"close-icon popup_hospiceb3_close\">\n\t                    <img src=\"/css/images/x-close-navy.svg\" alt=\"close-icon\">\n\t                </a>\n\t            "

To be a stranger invited to meet a family at the end stages of a loved one’s life, which is such a vulnerable space and time, is humbling to me.</p>\n<p>I was invited by the family of Eloise Stewart to be her Chaplain. When I first met Ms. Stewart and her family, she was imminent. Ms. Stewart was bedbound, not very responsive and she slept during my visits. I read scriptures to her and prayed with her. During this time, I got to know her daughter, Donna, very well. She was her mother’s primary caregiver and I spent most of my visits listening and engaging in conversation with her. Sadly, Ms. Stewart passed away after a month of receiving hospice care. When Donna asked if I could speak at her mother’s funeral, I was delighted. She shared several stories that were touching and showed she had wonderful memories of her mother.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;When I speak about the life of an individual at their funeral service, I try to find something that is simple, yet meaningful, to share. Donna shared a story of her mother growing up during the Great Depression. She always said, ‘It starts with a penny.’ Every time she found a penny, she picked it up and made a funny comment about it. Ms. Stewart’s daughters, Debbie, Donna and Denise, fondly recalled these moments with their mom. Because of this, I gave each of her daughters a penny in remembrance of their mother.</p>\n<p>While speaking at her funeral, my final words about their mother, were, ‘Mrs. Eloise V. Stewart lived an extraordinary life. She came from humble beginnings in Erwin, North Carolina. She grew up during the time of the Great Depression; a time when our country was at its lowest. I believe because of those humble times she found value in the simple things in life; like a lost penny. Some may even think a single penny left alone is insignificant and has very little value, but a single penny collected with other pennies has great impact if nurtured, respected and loved.’</p>\n<p>A week later, I received a wonderful message from Donna:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>‘Hi, Kinsley. Thank you so much for performing Mom’s funeral service. Just on the little I told you, you certainly captured her character. The pennies you gave us mean so much because we know what a penny meant to our mother. In fact, we appreciate it so much, we are having necklaces made with them. Thank you for giving us something in memory of Mom. Some might think it is odd to cherish a penny, but Mom worked so hard her entire life and always said it started with a penny! It was wonderful spending time with you and we wish you well, always. Thank you!’”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n                </div>\n            </div>        </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n                </div>\n    </div>\n\n\n\t                  <a class=\"close-icon popup_spiritua4_close\">\n\t                    <img src=\"/css/images/x-close-navy.svg\" alt=\"close-icon\">\n\t                </a>\n\t            "

She just adored Lori, her hospice aide. Lori went out of her way to make sure she attended to Mom’s needs, knowing how particular she was with her personal appearance and the neatness of her home. Nurses Zulmarie and Amanda were excellent in their communication throughout my mom’s care. I can’t say enough great things about both ladies!</p>\n<p>On the last day, I asked Amanda to turn around and come back 10 minutes after she left because I noticed a change in Mom. As I panicked, Amanda was there to help me, calmed me down and made the medications easy to understand. She explained why Mom was receiving the medications and noted exactly what times to administer. By this time, I was in full daughter mode. Amanda calmly talked with me and made sure I was prepared for what was going to happen.</p>\n<p>Dealing with the hospice team overall was a very pleasant experience.

Lori Gourama, volunteer coordinator, details the support Heartland received from the Greater Reading community:</p>\n<p>“Our goal was to deliver holiday decorations to each of our patients who live in skilled nursing facilities. Volunteers were recruited by adding a request in the United Way’s Volunteer 2020 Holiday Guide. Almost immediately, people started responding. Over and over again we heard that people are feeling helpless during this pandemic, so we were excited to find a way to reach out and help those who are being greatly impacted by the isolation of COVID-19. Most people are aware that residents of nursing facilities have been prevented from having visitors. Family, friends and volunteers have not been allowed into assisted and skilled nursing facilities. In many cases, the residents have been confined to their rooms and unable to participate in normal social activities. Creating holiday crafts was one way our team and the community could reach out and let the residents know that they are in the hearts and minds of our community. One volunteer crafter even motivated her Cub Scout troop to make decorations so they could learn the importance of helping others.</p>\n<p>Hospice programs throughout the country rely on highly trained volunteers to offer support and companionship to patients at the end-of-life and respite to the patients’ families. However, during the pandemic, volunteers have needed to reach out virtually. Heartland’s volunteers having been busy making phone calls when possible and writing notes and letters to patients for the past several months. “This craft project allowed us to open our program to additional volunteers and provide some holiday cheer to our patients and other residents of local facilities. The creativity and generosity of these crafters also lifted the spirits of our staff. This was a beautiful way to spread cheer this pandemic holiday season. We greatly appreciate the help from our volunteers and the community!”</p>\n\n\n                </div>\n            </div>        </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n                </div>\n    </div>\n\n\n\t                  <a class=\"close-icon popup_hospicet3_close\">\n\t                    <img src=\"/css/images/x-close-navy.svg\" alt=\"close-icon\">\n\t                </a>\n\t            "

How fitting that it is the month in which we express our gratitude and gratefulness at Thanksgiving, and throughout the month are reminded of our blessings. Yet not just the month, but every day the Heartland Hospice volunteers give their time and talent to enrich the lives of our loved ones, is a day to be grateful. Whether it is competent medical care, or a kind word or compassionate touch to the hand, or a song sung or instrument played, or a book, a magazine or a letter read, or a game played or craft completed, or balloons blown up and watched together as they 'dance and float' about the room; whether it is a soothing voice, or it is the listening ears, or a shared prayer expressing what my mother perhaps cannot express for herself, or simply the silent assurance of one’s presence, the affirmation of both laughter and tears -- it is evident that when a member of the Heartland Hospice team arrives to care for my mother, the day is made better. Thanks to my mom’s Heartland team for their compassionate care and affirmation of her good life by helping to give her a good death. As dementia chips away at her abilities, you support her in the things she can do. As her memory fades, you give her moments to cherish in real time. Please know that you are appreciated beyond these words for what you have chosen to do. With each visit, you give dignity to the life of someone you did not even know in the time when that life was very different.

My deepest gratitude to the entire team at Heartland Hospice.\"</blockquote>\n    \n\n\n                            \n    \n<p><img id=\"__mcenew\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" src=\"/media/6020/caregiver-award.jpg?width=359&amp;height=478\" alt=\"\" width=\"359\" height=\"478\" rel=\"12038\" data-id=\"12038\"></p>\n\n\n                </div>\n            </div>        </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n                </div>\n    </div>\n\n\n\t\t\t                  <a class=\"close-icon popup_secondPost_close\">\n\t\t\t                    <img src=\"/css/images/x-close-navy.svg\" alt=\"close-icon\">\n\t\t\t                </a>\n\t\t\t            "

We were out there for about two and half hours and covered 1.75 miles. Jay, Greg and Sara, account liaisons, dedicated their time and joined in on the fun cleaning up and we had a great day!

Before her 105th birthday, the hospice team held a pinning ceremony to recognize Annetta for her service and also presented her with a special wooden plaque.</p>\n<p>Meghan Wilinski, ProMedica Hospice senior account liaison, helped organize the pinning ceremony and birthday celebration for Annetta. She stated, “The ceremony was touching and brought tears to my eyes. Prior to Annetta receiving our hospice services, I had the opportunity to meet her and learn of her life and time in the military. After starting care with ProMedica, I learned her 105th birthday was coming up and I thought that there was no better time to honor and celebrate her.</p>\n<p>I refrain from saying to the veterans that I meet that they ‘were’ part of a particular branch of service because I feel that time in their lives is always a part of them. This was very evident with Annetta, even many years after her active military service. Being a part of the Army at 105 years old is something she is very proud of, will speak to and is special to her. It was a privilege and honor to all of us to recognize this amazing veteran and community member.\"</p>\n<p>Annetta received many awards and decorations for her service in the military, such as the World War II Victory Medal, the Good Conduct Medal, the WAAC Service Ribbon and the American Service Medal. She served in the Women’s Army Corps from 1943 until her honorable discharge in 1945 and ended her Army career as a Corporal.</p>\n<p>She was born in 1917 in rural Cumberland, Maryland among seven other brothers and sisters. She met her husband Eugene in the U.S Army when they both served during World War II. They were married for 60 years and had two children together.</p>\n<p>Annetta’s family shared that her life is full of adventure, from traveling throughout most of the United States by car, plane or train, to a special trip to Ireland with her daughter. For her 80th birthday, she went for a hot air balloon ride! Annetta was known for always asking, “What are we doing for excitement?”, a question her family lives by. She always had a love for animals and had numerous pets over her lifetime and had recently befriended a therapy dog.</p>\n<p>Jennifer had this to say after the birthday and military recognition event. \"My Grammie has always been a very proud Army WAC veteran. From the time I was a young girl, Grammie has always enjoyed talking about her military experiences and sharing photos from that time. Five of her seven siblings served in various branches of the military and in World War II. Grammie was absolutely tickled pink with the special pinning ceremony that took place to honor her service. At 105, she's seen a lot, and she certainly still knows what it means to salute and can easily recount her stories and memories from the war. It's not every day that someone turns 105, and I’m so grateful that ProMedica Hospice was able to help her ring in a very special year in such an honorable and profoundly special way. The services ProMedica has provided to date have been a meaningful and reassuring way to supplement my Grammie's daily care. I greatly value that they are so attentive in helping to ensure she's comfortable and getting whatever ‘extras’ she may need and very much deserves.\"</p>\n\n\n                </div>\n            </div>        </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n    <div>\n        <div class=\"container\">\n        <div class=\"row clearfix\">\n            <div class=\"span6 col\">\n                <div style=\"width: 100%;\">\n                            \n    \n    <img src=\"/media/11439/img_9809.jpg\" class=\"responsiveImg\">\n\n\n                </div>\n            </div>            <div class=\"span6 col\">\n                <div style=\"width: 100%;\">\n                            \n    \n    <img src=\"/media/11442/annetta.jpg\" class=\"responsiveImg\">\n\n\n                </div>\n            </div>        </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n    <div>\n        <div class=\"container\">\n        <div class=\"row clearfix\">\n            <div class=\"span6 col\">\n                <div style=\"width: 100%;\">\n                            \n    \n    <img src=\"/media/11437/img_0110.jpg\" class=\"responsiveImg\">\n\n\n                </div>\n            </div>            <div class=\"span6 col\">\n                <div style=\"width: 100%;\">\n                            \n    \n    <img src=\"/media/11438/img_6159.jpg\" class=\"responsiveImg\">\n\n\n                </div>\n            </div>        </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n                </div>\n    </div>\n\n\n\t                  <a class=\"close-icon popup_promedic1_close\">\n\t                    <img src=\"/css/images/x-close-navy.svg\" alt=\"close-icon\">\n\t                </a>\n\t            "

One such opportunity arose recently when a patient, Barb, began improving enough to express herself verbally after several months of care.</p>\n<p>Barb had always loved to play the organ and sing, and she had done well in music therapy with board-certified music therapist, Gaby. As she improved, Gaby suggested perhaps Barb would like to write a song for her family, to which Barb readily agreed. Gaby provided her with a few chord progressions and she chose her favorite one. From there, Barb and Gaby had conversations about what Barb wanted to say to her kids and husband, Al. Her inspiration stemmed from precious blue flowers that you might find in the woods. Barb completed the lyrics and practiced singing it herself for a few weeks before she finally recorded it from her bed. In November, she was able to share the song with her entire family for her birthday.</p>\n<p>When asked about the song, Barb’s daughter shared, “The song that Mom wrote and sang with Gaby is so beautiful. It was a special gift that our mom gave to US on HER birthday. Al is her biggest fan and supporter and was so excited to have us all hear it together at her 79<sup>th</sup> birthday party. My brothers and I are so grateful for this gift and we will cherish it forever.”</p>\n\n\n                </div>\n            </div>        </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n                </div>\n    </div>\n\n\n\t                  <a class=\"close-icon popup_hospicep2_close\">\n\t                    <img src=\"/css/images/x-close-navy.svg\" alt=\"close-icon\">\n\t                </a>\n\t            "

My words were well-intentioned and came from a sincere place.</p>\n<p>This was until I met Jim. Jim was introduced to me as a Marine who served in the Korean War; more specifically, the Chosin Reservoir. I instinctively thanked Jim for his service.</p>\n<p>I was not familiar with this battle, the Chosin Reservoir. I did not remember learning about it in high school so long ago and I had never met someone who spoke about it. That night I looked up the Chosin Reservoir.&nbsp; I was in tears. My tears were not because of the insane conditions these men were fighting in—and against.&nbsp; My tears came from a place of embarrassment. I thanked Jim without knowing the true service and sacrifice he gave our country. At this point, my <em>thank you</em> felt empty. I had met someone who fought in one of the most savage battles in Marine Corp history. The next day, I was with Jim again and told him about my research the night before. I offered him an apology for my ignorance when I thanked him the day prior. I asked Jim if I could thank him appropriately. I explained that I had no idea of the battle he served in and thanked him for teaching me a very important lesson that I would remember when thanking Veterans in the future. We embraced and from that day began to develop a strong friendship.</p>\n<p>When Jim and I would meet, I learned a little more about him as a person, as a father, as a husband. I became friends with someone who served as a frontline machine gunner and a squad leader in 5 major battles, including the battle of the Chosin Reservoir. I learned that Jim was a recipient of several military decorations including the Purple Heart Medal for injuries he received on the battlefield. I learned about Jim’s story.</p>\n<p>Those who served in the military have his or her own story surrounding time in service and individual sacrifices were made. Not all stories are the same and not every person has the same experience. The story <em>matters</em> and the individual Veteran <em>matters</em>.</p>\n<p>My lesson: Give <em>intention</em> to my thank you. Before I thank an individual Veteran for his or her service, I ask questions so that I may offer an informed thank you. Some questions I ask: What branch did you serve? When did you serve? How long did you serve? What was your job while serving?</p>\n<p>Nowadays, I am not thanking a Veteran…I am thanking a 'Jim' who enlisted at age 17 and served four years (1948-1952) in the Marine Corp as a machine gunner in the battle of the Chosin Reservoir in the Korean War.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n                </div>\n            </div>        </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n                </div>\n    </div>\n\n\n\t                  <a class=\"close-icon popup_eachindi4_close\">\n\t                    <img src=\"/css/images/x-close-navy.svg\" alt=\"close-icon\">\n\t                </a>\n\t            "

The other morning the wife called me with a completely different perspective of hospice and the care they provide.

The wife was distraught and not very clear. I was asked to visit this patient and his family first before going to my other appointments.” &nbsp;</p>\n<p>When Tina arrived the patient was in pain, struggling to breath and very scared. She gave him his medicine and made him comfortable in his bed. “I told him that I would be with him as long as he needed me. I sat at his bedside at eye level and told him, <em>just look at me</em>,” explained Tina.</p>\n<p>Tina continued to talk quietly to the patient while holding his hand and keeping him calm. At one point, he spoke two words to her, “thank you.” His family later told Tina those were the first words he had spoken in the last few days. She never left his bedside and was with him as he took his last breath. Tina explains, “He comforted me just as much as I comforted him. He also reminded me that sometimes schedules and plans are not the most important part of my job.”</p>\n<p>“I firmly believe we are put exactly where we are meant to be and I was supposed to be there with him. Death is as much a part of life as being born. Someone transitioning deserves the same love and compassion as a new baby entering the world. This patient shared his last hours of life with me. That is truly the highest honor and privilege I could ever hope for,” added Tina.</p>\n\n\n                </div>\n            </div>        </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n                </div>\n    </div>\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t                </section>\n\t\t\t\t              <a class=\"close-icon popup_beingthe4_close\">\n\t\t\t\t                <img src=\"/css/images/x-close-navy.svg\" alt=\"close-icon\">\n\t\t\t\t            </a>\n\t\t\t\t        "

The wife was distraught and not very clear.

She gave him his medicine and made him comfortable in his bed. “I told him that I would be with him as long as he needed me. I sat at his bedside at eye level and told him, <em>just look at me</em>,” explained Tina.</p>\n<p>Tina continued to talk quietly to the patient while holding his hand and keeping him calm. At one point, he spoke two words to her, “thank you.” His family later told Tina those were the first words he had spoken in the last few days. She never left his bedside and was with him as he took his last breath. Tina explains, “He comforted me just as much as I comforted him. He also reminded me that sometimes schedules and plans are not the most important part of my job.”</p>\n<p>“I firmly believe we are put exactly where we are meant to be and I was supposed to be there with him. Death is as much a part of life as being born. Someone transitioning deserves the same love and compassion as a new baby entering the world. This patient shared his last hours of life with me. That is truly the highest honor and privilege I could ever hope for,” added Tina.</p>\n\n\n                </div>\n            </div>        </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n                </div>\n    </div>\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t                </section>\n\t\t\t\t              <a class=\"close-icon popup_beingthe4_close\">\n\t\t\t\t                <img src=\"/css/images/x-close-navy.svg\" alt=\"close-icon\">\n\t\t\t\t            </a>\n\t\t\t\t        "

We commend these organizations for their continuous focus on delivering the highest quality of care to their patients”, said Rob Paulsson, President of SHP.</p>\n<p>Susan Ward, Heartland Hospice Administrator, said, “Having won top 20% for 2016, 2017 and 2018, our agency set a goal to improve our performance and exceed the top 20% for the 2019 year. We were thrilled to have achieved top 5%! We have set very high standards for our staff with the intention to provide exceptional care for every single patient and family we encounter. Our clinical leaders set their own standards high and they demonstrate this example for all our nursing and support staff. Our success is based on longevity and experience among our staff with an average total length of service of 9.9 years among our clinical team, including nurses, aides, chaplains and social workers.”</p>\n<p>Julee Crawley, Director of Professional Service for Heartland Hospice, said, “It is a true honor to receive this award. I am so proud of our team who strives every day to provide the best care and dignity for our patients and families. When you truly work every day to meet and exceed patient and family expectations, all other aspects fall into place. We will continue to strive to provide exceptional care at a time when patients need us the most.”</p>\n<p><a rel=\"noopener\" href=\"https://www.shpdata.com/hospice/shpbest-cahps-hospice/\" target=\"_blank\">Read more</a> about the SHPBest awards program, including methodology and award recipient lists.</p>\n\n\n                </div>\n            </div>        </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n                </div>\n    </div>\n\n\n\t                  <a class=\"close-icon popup_heartlan1_close\">\n\t                    <img src=\"/css/images/x-close-navy.svg\" alt=\"close-icon\">\n\t                </a>\n\t            "

I can say after losing my mom, the pandemic and job loss have been an inconvenience.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>I appreciated the correspondence, the follow-up phone calls and the fact I always knew you were there. Mom's birthday was the hardest, but the family gathered at her favorite restaurant, ordered her favorite dinner and with party hats and flowers, we celebrated and remembered the good times.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>So now I want to take a minute to thank you all and let you know that you have been my lighthouse in dark times. Knowing someone was there for me if I needed them got me through this tough time. I still find myself telling mom things. As a Christian, I know she can hear me and she knows what is going on in my life and I have found peace in that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Thank you all for what you do. You are truly angels when the grief is at its hardest. God bless you all and good luck in the years to come.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Gayle &amp; Family</blockquote>\n\n\n                </div>\n            </div>        </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n                </div>\n    </div>\n\n\n\t                  <a class=\"close-icon popup_heartlan2_close\">\n\t                    <img src=\"/css/images/x-close-navy.svg\" alt=\"close-icon\">\n\t                </a>\n\t            "

She has recruited volunteers with sign language proficiency to assist patients who are hearing-impaired. She has put together a volunteer team to assist with birthday parties, another for nail polishing and yet another that sends out cards of encouragement to patients. Most impressive is her caring for veterans. She has assembled a volunteer team that visits patients when admitted and presents them with a pin and certificate, thanking them for their service. Another part of her veterans program includes presentation of the service flags of each branch of the military and folding of the American flag, which occurs seven times a year. Her caring extends to co-workers, as well, such as leading efforts to assist fellow employees in need, all the while living the company’s core values. </p>\n<p>Karen was chosen from among finalists representing each of HCR ManorCare’s five operating divisions.</p>\n<p>We congratulate Karen, our 2019 third-quarter HCR ManorCare Champion of Caring, and each of her peer finalists. All exhibit the qualities of champion caregivers.”<br></p>\n\n\n                </div>\n            </div>        </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n                </div>\n    </div>\n\n\n\t                  <a class=\"close-icon popup_hcrmanor4_close\">\n\t                    <img src=\"/css/images/x-close-navy.svg\" alt=\"close-icon\">\n\t                </a>\n\t            "

As a volunteer coordinator at Heartland Hospice serving North Central Indiana, Norene frequently provides her team with resources to support patients and their families through the grieving process. She sensed a need within her local community for greater and more accessible resources, especially amongst individuals diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease and related memory disorders.</p>\n<p>Often referred to as “The Long Goodbye”, individuals suffering from memory disorders, as well as their families and caregivers, often experience grief and loss throughout the progression of illness as abilities are lost, as well as upon the individual’s passing. Because of this progression of grief, Norene and her team partnered with their local Alzheimer’s/Dementia Services of Northern Indiana to install a free grief resources lending library. This library contains numerous books on a variety of grief-related topics, both specific to memory loss and of a more general nature.</p>\n<p>These materials were supported by a grant from the ProMedica Hospice Memorial Fund, a financial resource that is generously supported by grateful patients and their families as well as donations in memory of individuals who have passed away. The ProMedica Hospice Memorial Fund enables grant-making to Heartland Hospice patients and families in the amount of $500-$1,500 to seven potential categories, including funding bereavement resources such grief libraries, end-of-life wish fulfillment, grief camps for children, community memorial services, caregiver transition expenses, educational events, and supporting patients and families in financial distress. For more information on this valuable resource, visit the <a rel=\"noopener\" href=\"http://www.promedicaseniorcare.org/giving\" target=\"_blank\">website</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The grief resource library is available to any interested parties and can be found at 1151 S. Michigan St. South Bend, IN. Books may be borrowed for any length of time needed and patrons are asked to return the book to the library once they are finished reading it so that it may also benefit others.</p>\n\n\n                            \n    \n    <img src=\"/media/10680/south-bend-team-with-books.jpg\" class=\"responsiveImg\">\n\n\n                </div>\n            </div>        </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n                </div>\n    </div>\n\n\n\t                  <a class=\"close-icon popup_promedic1_close\">\n\t                    <img src=\"/css/images/x-close-navy.svg\" alt=\"close-icon\">\n\t                </a>\n\t            "

Hearing survival stories from women living with heart disease make the facts and figures we read come to life. Mia Albert, account liaison for Heartland Hospice serving North Central Indiana, shares her story to help educate women on risk and what to look for in case of a heart attack:</p>\n<p>“I went to the ER for nausea, vomiting and pain between my shoulder blades. I thought I was having a gallbladder attack, but imaging showed my gallbladder looked fine. They did end up finding a kidney stone, so I was sent to a urologist who said he didn’t know what was going on with my symptoms but that it wasn’t a kidney stone.</p>\n<p>Three days after I was released from the hospital with no real answer to my symptoms, I was back in the ER with excruciating neck and jaw pain. My EKG was normal, but when they drew cardiac indicators, my troponin was elevated which pointed them to the suspicion of a heart attack. They did a cardiac catheterization and not only confirmed I had a heart attack, but that I had multiple arteries that would require bypasses.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, this all happened in April 2020 and COVID-19 restrictions were very heavy. I waited two days in the hospital alone for my open heart surgery. My husband could come in for one hour before the surgery and got to wait for updates during surgery. But I spent the rest of my hospital stay without any friends and family. I was very fortunate to have many staff members who had heard my story through mutual friends. They came in my room to visit and pass along their support and prayers. A good friend of ours is a runner and he would run laps around the hospital and wave to me through my window as he passed by. I returned home a few days later after surgery where my husband, son and family took care of me. We were lucky enough to have meals delivered to our porch from our friends and church family.</p>\n<p>To me, it is very important to share my story, especially with other women. When I saw the statistic that women are seven times more likely to be misdiagnosed when having a heart attack, I had this urgency to share everything I went through. I’m doing this for every woman who was ever told her life-threatening heart condition was stress, anxiety, her weight or all in her head. As women, and especially for myself as a mother, we tend to get so busy taking care of others that we don’t always recognize when we need cared for. We definitely have to advocate for ourselves, too. My story is the same story as too many other women and it IS costing us our lives.”</p>\n\n\n                </div>\n            </div>        </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n                </div>\n    </div>\n\n\n\t                  <a class=\"close-icon popup_miashare3_close\">\n\t                    <img src=\"/css/images/x-close-navy.svg\" alt=\"close-icon\">\n\t                </a>\n\t            "

I encourage all organizations to do something similar. I’ve been donating blood for years and know the importance of donating to help save lives.”</p>\n<p>17 people donated blood; 10 of them being Heartland Hospice employees. Stephanie Reed, Heartland Hospice team coordinator, said, “I donated blood because it has been almost two years since the last time I donated, and I wanted to get back into donating regularly. It makes me feel good knowing that I can help my community by doing this.” Tracy Grabill, Heartland’s director of professional services, added, “I have never given blood before. After hearing of the need, especially during this time of COVID-19, I decided it was my time to give. You never know what life brings and I may be in a situation where I need blood and will have to be thankful to the people who have donated for me.”</p>\n\n\n                            \n    \n    <img src=\"/media/9782/img_0265.jpg\" class=\"responsiveImg\">\n\n\n                </div>\n            </div>        </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n                </div>\n    </div>\n\n\n\t                  <a class=\"close-icon popup_heartlan4_close\">\n\t                    <img src=\"/css/images/x-close-navy.svg\" alt=\"close-icon\">\n\t                </a>\n\t            "

When that compassion reaches a patient’s family, that's when we know we have truly lived out our Mission. ProMedica Hospice Serving Metropolitan Detroit recently received a lovely letter from the daughter of a patient citing the compassionate care her mom received:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>On August 29, I said, \"I love you\" to my mom for the last time. Doris Robinson Spann was 103 years old. Mom spent her life in my hometown of Coatesville, Pennsylvania until last year when she moved to Michigan to live with me and my husband. It was beautiful having her here with us. It was truly an honor to care for my mom who had lived her life giving of herself to her family, friends and community. In gratitude for her forty years of founding and operating a food cupboard, the city of Coatesville named a street Doris A. Robinson Spann Boulevard in tribute.</p>\n<p>We did have a visiting nurse practitioner come in a few months after Mom arrived. She suggested we request the services of hospice. I was shocked! To me, hospice meant death and Mom was doing great! She reassured me that hospice is much more than end of life care, so I looked into the services. Calling in ProMedica was the best thing I could have done for Mom and our family!</p>\n<p>The ProMedica Hospice team, led by RN Rachel, took care of EVERYTHING! They could not have been more wonderful. They handled everything my mom needed. They managed all the medical invoices, her medicines and any supplies that were required. Their care allowed me to focus on my mom as my mom, and not my patient. It was so good for our relationship.</p>\n<p>Mom has been in nursing for over 30 years at the VA Hospital in Coatesville, so she knew quite a bit about health care and medicine. She wasn’t excited about bringing in outside help, as she didn’t think she needed it yet. But these nurses were incredibly professional and so very kind that before long, she would smile and say, \"I love you’\"to Rachel whenever she walked into the room.</p>\n<p>While this team of angels certainly took care of Mom’s comfort, they also went above and beyond to see my family’s needs. They were concerned about our health and our emotional well-being too. A couple of weeks before Mom passed, when her health took a turn for the worse, our nurses took what could have been a terribly distressing time for all of us and made it beautiful. ProMedica did more than just help Mom pass peacefully, they brought reverence and grace to the entire process. We appreciated their presence more than they will ever know.</p>\n<p>My wish is that in addition to expressing my sincere gratitude to the ProMedica Hospice team, I can also help others know that hospice is a blessing. Providing this kind of care is truly a life calling. Rachel and her team have certainly answered that call and we are all the better for having them in our home.</p>\n<p>Most sincerely,</p>\n<p>Diana Lewis,&nbsp;Ret. News Anchor,&nbsp;Channel 7 WXYZ-TV</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n                </div>\n            </div>        </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n                </div>\n    </div>\n\n\n\t                  <a class=\"close-icon popup_daughter1_close\">\n\t                    <img src=\"/css/images/x-close-navy.svg\" alt=\"close-icon\">\n\t                </a>\n\t            "

His grandson, Joshua, and fiancé, Eden, were beginning to plan their wedding, but when Steve’s health began to decline, Joshua wanted nothing more than to make sure his grandfather was able to be there for the big day. The Heartland Hospice team immediately helped Joshua and Eden plan their wedding to fulfill both Steve and Joshua’s Heart’s Desire.</p>\n<p>The hospice team reached out to the team at CentraCare - Long Prairie Meadow Place where Steve resides to let them know about their plans. Both teams worked together to create a very special and memorable day for Steve, Joshua, Eden and their closest loved ones. Pamela Nickel, Heartland Hospice spiritual care coordinator, wrote a special ceremony for the happy couple. The day was tearful for everyone in attendance, but also full of laughter as they enjoyed each other’s company and final moments with Steve. Joshua was especially tearful because of his incredibly close relationship with his grandfather.</p>\n<p>“Now I have a granddaughter, and she is so beautiful,” Steve said with excitement. It meant so much to him to be able to celebrate his grandson’s marriage and spend time with his loved ones. Pamela was grateful to be part of this special day and shared, “It is always an honor to preside at weddings, but this one has a special meaning because not only was it for Steve, but it was also for his grandson who cared so deeply for his grandfather. It was so fun and times like this make my job meaningful. It filled up my cup!”</p>\n<p>Steve passed away several days after the wedding, but Joshua, Eden and their families have a special moment to look back on and fondly remember Steve and their time with him.</p>\n\n\n                </div>\n            </div>        </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n    <div>\n        <div class=\"container\">\n        <div class=\"row clearfix\">\n            <div class=\"span4 col\">\n                <div style=\"width: 100%;\">\n                            \n    \n    <img src=\"/media/11272/img_20220316_130136400_hdr.jpg\" class=\"responsiveImg\">\n\n\n                </div>\n            </div>            <div class=\"span4 col\">\n                <div style=\"width: 100%;\">\n                            \n    \n    <img src=\"/media/11274/img_20220316_130355491_burst000_cover.jpg\" class=\"responsiveImg\">\n\n\n                </div>\n            </div>            <div class=\"span4 col\">\n                <div style=\"width: 100%;\">\n                            \n    \n    <img src=\"/media/11277/img_20220316_132530605_hdr.jpg\" class=\"responsiveImg\">\n\n\n                </div>\n            </div>        </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n                </div>\n    </div>\n\n\n\t                  <a class=\"close-icon popup_hospicet2_close\">\n\t                    <img src=\"/css/images/x-close-navy.svg\" alt=\"close-icon\">\n\t                </a>\n\t            "

When that compassion reaches our patients’ families, that's when we know we have truly lived out our Mission. Heartland Hospice Serving St. Cloud, Brainerd and Surrounding Areas recently received a testimonial from the family of a patient citing the compassionate care and support their mother received.</p>\n<blockquote>Our family was introduced to Heartland Hospice after our mom was discharged from the hospital on palliative care. She had been hospitalized a few times within a short period and doctors were not able to determine the infection source, so treatment was not an option. Friends informed us of the wonderful care their mother received when she was a patient with Heartland Hospice.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Sandy, nurse, and Pamela, chaplain, met with us the day Mom was discharged from the hospital. They assisted us with paperwork and shared information regarding services Heartland provides. I received a call from the social worker, Judy, the following week asking how I was doing since I am Mom's caregiver. Heartland provides outstanding care for the patient and also provides excellent support for the family. Their concern for everyone's welfare is genuine.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Mom has vascular dementia, so she has good and bad days with memory. She is no longer able to walk. The Heartland team made sure to check on her multiple times, day and night, and even came up with ideas to help make her bed a safer place at night. Mom enjoys the care Breanna, hospice aide, provides with weekly baths. Mom's comfort and welfare are always a priority.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Pamela has brought calm and relaxation with her prayers, readings and songs. I have been there many times to also benefit from the messages she shares. Church and faith have been important in Mom's life and Pamela's visits boosts Mom's spirits. She has commented many times about Pamela's beautiful voice.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Keshia, volunteer coordinator, has also visited Mom and arranged for additional caring and kind visitors to bring joy to Mom's life. Thank you, Meg and Charles, for volunteering your gifts of time and support.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Whether it is Brooke's, Team Coordinator, kind voice answering the phone when we call with a question, or nurses who check on Mom's well-being, or spiritual support, or team members keeping us updated on medications... Heartland is outstanding! The many details our family used to be in charge of or concerned about have been taken care of by Heartland. The Heartland team provides expertise, support and compassion for their patients and their families. We are able to focus on Mom and our precious time with her. That is been the greatest blessing.&nbsp;</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Thank you!</blockquote>\n\n\n                </div>\n            </div>        </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n                </div>\n    </div>\n\n\n\t                  <a class=\"close-icon popup_familyth3_close\">\n\t                    <img src=\"/css/images/x-close-navy.svg\" alt=\"close-icon\">\n\t                </a>\n\t            "

This year, the walks were not their typical large in-person gatherings. Instead, the walk took place “everywhere” and they encouraged participants and teams to choose any sidewalk, track or trail in their area. Conducting the walks in this fashion helped encouraged social distancing between the participants.</p>\n<p>While the Alzheimer’s Association’s Walk to End Alzheimer’s might have looked a little different this year, employees of Heartland Hospice serving St. Cloud, Brainerd and Surrounding Areas came together as a team and did whatever they could to support and participate.</p>\n<p>On October 15<sup>th</sup> at Belle Prairie County Park in Little Falls, Minnesota, 22 Heartland Hospice team members participated in the Walk to End Alzheimer’s. With fundraising being a challenge this year, the team members decided to donate some of their own money and $500 was collected to give to the Alzheimer’s Association.</p>\n<p>“While working with Heartland Hospice, I have seen firsthand how an Alzheimer's diagnosis can affect a patient, their family and loved ones, and their lives as a whole. We do everything we can to support our patients and helping to put an end to this terrible disease is our ultimate goal. Thank you for joining us in this fight to end Alzheimer's!\" said Jessica Dingman, volunteer coordinator.</p>\n\n\n                            \n    \n    <img src=\"/media/9864/alz-pic-4.jpg\" class=\"responsiveImg\">\n\n\n                </div>\n            </div>        </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n                </div>\n    </div>\n\n\n\t                  <a class=\"close-icon popup_hospicet4_close\">\n\t                    <img src=\"/css/images/x-close-navy.svg\" alt=\"close-icon\">\n\t                </a>\n\t            "

For most of us, it’s hard to imagine the passion and conviction it requires to selflessly care for others in some of their deepest times of need. Jennifer (Jb) Kotlowski is no stranger to tribulation. As a care transition nurse for Heartland Hospice serving Central Wisconsin, Jb educates providers, patients and families about hospice care and how to maximize the hospice benefit.</p>\n<p>Many times, friendships can form between the hospice care team and patients and families, or sometimes, friendships exist before the care team and patient relationship. Jb and the Neil Laube family share a most meaningful Christmas memory. “I met Neil Laube and his wife Mary Jo through church,” Jb shared. “I initially didn’t know them well, but they made it a point to talk with me every Sunday and would often dote on my children. Mary Jo and Neil Laube exude kindness and I felt like they invited my family in without using any words,” she said. “They’re very generous people.”</p>\n<p>According to all who knew him, Neil loved nature, travel and especially his family. His children note that they counted on his unwavering support and encouragement. “Dad always showed up for us kids, our partners, his grandkids, 4-H members, neighbors and friends,” one daughter shared. Another daughter admired him for his calming and comforting presence--at the ready with words, looks and hugs.</p>\n<p>One endearing thing everyone knew about Neil was that he didn’t just look like Santa Claus, he was thoroughly enchanted by all things Christmas. “He loved it all: Christmas Eve services, hymns, carols, classic Christmas songs, movies, food, going for drives to see the decorations, browsing in stores that had creative and artistic offerings, family,” said Mary Jo. “He never quit believing in the spirit of Santa,” she said.</p>\n<p>Before Neil fell ill and became a patient served by Heartland Hospice, he and Mary Jo enjoyed exploring the United States together. Mary Jo said they specifically appreciated looking at flora and fauna, visiting historical places, discovering new things, trying new foods and meeting new people. “Visiting, or at least touching, all 50 states became a goal,” she said. Because he was a man who gave so much of himself, Jb felt compelled to return the kindness Neil had shown her and so many others. She subsequently devised a plan to fulfill the smiley-faced Santa’s goal.</p>\n<p>“It was a surprise,” she said. “I didn’t tell Mary Jo what I had planned.” Jb believes Mary Jo and Neil had accepted visiting 49 of 50 U.S. states as an excellent accomplishment, and sufficient. But it wasn’t sufficient for her, so she got to work helping them visit the only state they’d missed, Rhode Island. “I reached out to the Rhode Island State Park Service who happily helped me put my plan in motion,” she said. “They sent me a pinecone, rocks, patches and even a pin from one of their parks.”</p>\n<p>During the Christmas season, just days before Neil’s passing, Jb asked Mary Jo if she could come by for a visit. Despite having a houseful of his beloved family, Mary Jo welcomed her. “Neil was the best conversationalist!” Jb exclaimed. “He and I had widely different opinions about many things, but the conversation was always impeccable.” But this time Jb didn’t know what to say, nor how to present her gift. “I handed him a rock and stumbled through an explanation about how it was a magic rock. He agreed. He saw the magic in everything,” she said. “We were holding hands and I told him it was special, just like he is.” Eventually, Jb told Neil the rock he was holding was from Rhode Island, and now he’d officially touched a part of all 50 states. “My eyes were welling up before I finished speaking. Neil cried too,” she said. Jb witnessed as Neil very lovingly touched all the items that had come from Rhode Island with a look of awe, gratitude and maybe even relief. “It was one of the most beautiful moments of my life,” she said.</p>\n<p>Mary Jo thinks of Jb as a gem. “Neil loved her and was overwhelmed by her thoughtfulness,” she said. “He held that rock for a long time and cried when he told others about this loving young woman who found a way to make visiting 50 states a special kind of reality.”</p>\n\n\n                            \n    \n    <img src=\"/media/11015/laube-family.jpg\" class=\"responsiveImg\">\n\n\n                </div>\n            </div>        </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n                </div>\n    </div>\n\n\n\t                  <a class=\"close-icon popup_hospicet4_close\">\n\t                    <img src=\"/css/images/x-close-navy.svg\" alt=\"close-icon\">\n\t                </a>\n\t            "

She has been with ProMedica since 2018 and previously worked as a Chaplin for hospitals in Kentucky and Virginia.</p>\n<p>Priscila wanted to be more effective in the way she helps grieving families, so in 2020 she obtained her Grief Counseling Certification with the American Institute of Health Care Professionals and became an Alzheimer’s Community Educator with the Alzheimer’s Association. The knowledge she gained from each has helped her start support groups for families adjusting to hospice care and provide education on a patient’s diagnosis with Alzheimer’s.</p>\n<p>Currently, Priscila hosts monthly face-to-face and virtual support groups, around nine seminars per year, four grief art activities a year, grief events and memorial services such as a dove release ceremony. These support groups and services are helping families who are having a difficult time adjusting to the prognosis of their loved ones. She also held a stress relief group for the employees at ProMedica called “Self-care Day”.</p>\n<p>Family members appreciate Priscila for her thoughtfulness and willingness to host these support groups for them. Some are just trying to pass the time adjusting to their loss and these groups have helped to support them and their feelings more easily. Families also send Priscila cards, flowers and cookies to show their appreciation.</p>\n<p>Priscila had this to share about her time with ProMedica, the hospice team and the families she has helped, “I love what I do. I am going on five years with ProMedica Hospice and have the privilege to help those who trust our team with their loved one’s care. I have talked with over 2,000 people during this time, and it has been such a positive experience for families because the entire team of nurses, CNAs, spiritual care coordinators, social workers and volunteers are doing their best to love and care for patients and families.”</p>\n<p>“The bereavement program is successful because of everyone working together to provide caring services for patients and their families during end of life. My administrators are understanding and when I need any type of assistance or support for the bereavement program, they help to make things happen. The bereaved families come to me impressed with the services and want to know more about the bereavement services available. It is an honor to work with a team who really cares about the patient and their family’s needs.”</p>\n\n\n                </div>\n            </div>        </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n    <div>\n        <div class=\"container\">\n        <div class=\"row clearfix\">\n            <div class=\"span4 col\">\n                <div style=\"width: 100%;\">\n                            \n    \n    <img src=\"/media/11866/support-group-art-3.jpg\" class=\"responsiveImg\">\n\n\n                </div>\n            </div>            <div class=\"span4 col\">\n                <div style=\"width: 100%;\">\n                            \n    \n    <img src=\"/media/11869/support-group-art-6.jpg\" class=\"responsiveImg\">\n\n\n                </div>\n            </div>            <div class=\"span4 col\">\n                <div style=\"width: 100%;\">\n                            \n    \n    <img src=\"/media/11867/support-group-art-4.jpg\" class=\"responsiveImg\">\n\n\n                </div>\n            </div>        </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n                </div>\n    </div>\n\n\n\t                  <a class=\"close-icon popup_promedic1_close\">\n\t                    <img src=\"/css/images/x-close-navy.svg\" alt=\"close-icon\">\n\t                </a>\n\t            "

The free bereavement day camp features therapeutic activities, arts and crafts and team building exercises led by a team of professional counselors, hospice team members and trained volunteers. Children explore issues related to the impact that loss can have on their lives in a safe and supportive atmosphere.</p>\n<p>Ava, Kaiah and Kali Duncan shared photos of their mom with other campers at Camp Fearless. “Our mom passed away when we were really little. We’ve been doing really fun projects, some just for us and some for our lost loved one,” said Ava. “It makes you feel better,” said Kali. “It makes you feel like, happy. Not sad or anything,” said Kaiah. The girls lost their mom about eight years ago and have been going to Camp Fearless the past three summers.</p>\n<p>Camp Fearless is offered in a number of communities across northwest Ohio and Southeast Michigan during the summer. The theme for camp this year is “Growing in Grief” in which the kids are making pop bottle planters and piecing broken pots back together. “Our goal is to teach them healthy coping skills so that they can move forward in their adventures in life,” said Kelly Macy, ProMedica Hospice Social Worker.</p>\n<p>Through the activities; volunteers and camp leaders encourage the kids to find different ways to cope with their emotions and let them out. The camp leaders notice a true transformation. “They’re really awesome kids and how they come from being afraid to walk in the doors, to being best friends with people by the time they leave,” said Kelly.</p>\n<p>The program also provides an opportunity for parents and guardians to meet individually with camp leaders to discuss the individual needs of the children and family following loss. Hospice staff provides information and connects families with additional resources to help children continue to grow and move forward on their grief journey.</p>\n<p><a rel=\"noopener\" href=\"https://www.wtol.com/article/news/camp-fearless-helps-grieving-children/512-589bb97c-4661-4704-be62-1bed604e9f35\" target=\"_blank\">WTOL Story and Video</a></p>\n\n\n                </div>\n            </div>        </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n    <div>\n        <div class=\"container\">\n        <div class=\"row clearfix\">\n            <div class=\"span6 col\">\n                <div style=\"width: 100%;\">\n                            \n    \n    <img src=\"/media/8811/hands.jpg\" class=\"responsiveImg\">\n\n\n                </div>\n            </div>            <div class=\"span6 col\">\n                <div style=\"width: 100%;\">\n                            \n    \n    <img src=\"/media/8812/ava-kaiah-kali-2.jpg\" class=\"responsiveImg\">\n\n\n                </div>\n            </div>        </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n    <div>\n        <div class=\"container\">\n        <div class=\"row clearfix\">\n            <div class=\"span6 col\">\n                <div style=\"width: 100%;\">\n                            \n    \n    <img src=\"/media/8816/day-1-morning-activity-16.jpg\" class=\"responsiveImg\">\n\n\n                </div>\n            </div>            <div class=\"span6 col\">\n                <div style=\"width: 100%;\">\n                            \n    \n    <img src=\"/media/8810/crafts.jpg\" class=\"responsiveImg\">\n\n\n                </div>\n            </div>        </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n                </div>\n    </div>\n\n\n\t                  <a class=\"close-icon popup_promedic2_close\">\n\t                    <img src=\"/css/images/x-close-navy.svg\" alt=\"close-icon\">\n\t                </a>\n\t            "

When that compassion reaches our patients’ families, that's when we know we have truly lived out our Mission. Heartland Hospice serving Northwestern Michigan recently received a wonderful testimonial from Chelsea, the granddaughter of a hospice patient, citing the compassionate care her grandmother received:</p>\n<p>“My family and I are so incredibly grateful to Heartland Hospice of Northwestern Michigan for their care of my grandma during the last months of her life. When she first went on hospice, my family was pretty sure that she only had days or weeks to live due to her rapidly declining health and complications from dementia. After she started hospice, her quality of life improved dramatically. Our nurse was amazing and quickly got her pain under control. As a result, she felt so much better and was back to getting herself out of bed and going out to dinner and eating all the sweets she wanted.</p>\n<p>Towards the end when it became apparent to everyone that she didn’t have much longer, our nurse, the hospice team and the staff at her assisted living facility continued to monitor her closely and manage her pain which ensured she was comfortable to the very end. We are honestly so thankful and amazed at the important work that Heartland Hospice does and continues to do for families in this area. I would highly recommend them to care for those at the end-of-life.”</p>\n\n\n                </div>\n            </div>        </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n                </div>\n    </div>\n\n\n\t                  <a class=\"close-icon popup_heartlan1_close\">\n\t                    <img src=\"/css/images/x-close-navy.svg\" alt=\"close-icon\">\n\t                </a>\n\t            "

Literally the day we called, arrangements were made to have everything needed in the home before Grandma was released from the hospital. The next morning, everything showed up and was set up for Grandma to come home and be comfortable.</p>\n<p>Each and every person involved with Grandma's care was personable, caring, sincere and professional. It was as if they were caring for their own family member. They were readily available whenever we had questions or concerns. Not only did they care for Grandma and her needs, but they were also concerned with the wellbeing of each of us as the caregivers. After some time, we needed to put Grandma in long term care, and yet again, they immediately went to work to find the best place possible for her. Everything was done for us so all we had to do was love Grandma and enjoy our time with her.</p>\n<p>I cannot say enough about Heartland Hospice and the ENTIRE Traverse City, Michigan team. I would recommend them over and over again. If you are considering hospice care for a loved one, call Heartland Hospice. They will even come to you and make everything as easy as possible.

At Heartland, caring for military veterans begins with identifying and evaluating the impact of each veteran’s experience. We find out:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>the branch of military in which the veteran served, and when</li>\n<li>whether the veteran saw combat or was stationed on the front line</li>\n<li>the VA benefits for which the veteran may be eligible</li>\n</ul>\n<p>At Heartland Hospice Serving Tucson and Green Valley, our team has received specialized education regarding veterans who served during the time of war to understand their health challenges, psychological challenges and spiritual challenges. Different kinds of trauma can be experienced by different veterans in different wars. We’ve learned a critical lesson: a patient’s military service history helps determine which kind of personalized, compassionate care we should provide. Working with the veteran and his or her physician and family members, we can customize our care plans accordingly.</p>\n<p>We believe that educating individuals about the unique needs of military-connected people in our country can change perceptions, create powerful connections, strengthen communities and help our nation’s heroes access resources that allow them to thrive.</p>\n<p>Our team is a proud partner of the We Honor Veterans program which is a collaboration between the U.S. Veterans Administration and the National Hospice and Palliative Care Association. The goal is to increase veterans’ awareness of these services and continually improve their quality of life.</p>\n<p>We take great pride in honoring all our veterans. Some of the ways our team honors our veterans are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Capturing their Stories</strong> – Our volunteers sit down with the patients to listen and learn about their experiences while serving.</li>\n<li><strong>Veteran Recognition </strong>– We honor all our veterans with a certificate, flag pin, quilt and a military bear. Family members are also invited to attend the recognition ceremonies.</li>\n<li><strong>Vet-to-Vet Volunteering</strong> – No one understands the questions and concerns of a military veteran more than fellow veterans or active duty personnel. Volunteers with similar backgrounds can meet with and assist in the care of veteran patients. Veterans share a common language, and code of conduct and honor. Trust often develops faster between people who have common life experiences. When one veteran talks to another, stoicism and secrecy may dissolve; sharing supports life-review and healing.</li>\n<li><strong>Support for Veterans Families</strong> – Our team is prepared to help connect families to community resources and Veterans Affairs programs in which they are eligible to participle.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For questions about our veteran services, please contact one of our social workers or our volunteer department.</p>\n\n\n                </div>\n            </div>        </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n                </div>\n    </div>\n\n\n\t                  <a class=\"close-icon popup_heartlan2_close\">\n\t                    <img src=\"/css/images/x-close-navy.svg\" alt=\"close-icon\">\n\t                </a>\n\t            "

Level Five is the highest level We Honor Veterans partners can attain and includes several new required activities and yearly recertification.</p>\n<p>All wars are different and provide unique experiences and often difficulties for the Veterans who served in them. We Honor Veterans was launched by the National Hospice and Palliative Care Organization in collaboration with the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to help improve the care veterans receive from hospice and palliative care providers.</p>\n<p>“Achieving Level Five is such a tremendous honor. Each level was a stepping stone in ensuring that not only were our Veterans thanked and recognized, but also that our staff was educated on Veteran specific topics,” said Paula Potter, Heartland Hospice Volunteer Coordinator. “Our patients look back on their time served as an important part of history. It is a privilege to show them how much we appreciate their valor and sacrifices while serving our country. We want our Veterans to always know that our hospice team thanks them from the bottom of our hearts for all they did to keep us safe and we are thankful for their service.”</p>\n<p>“I am so thankful to lead such an amazing team that serves our Veterans. It is humbling to be able to care for those who have sacrificed so much for our country” said Jessica Pope, Heartland Hospice Administrator. “Paula worked so hard to achieve this Level Five status! I am in awe of her commitment and dedication. As a team, we accept the responsibility of continuing to serve our veterans, care for them and their families and educate our community on such an honorable platform. I am thankful that there is a program such as We Honor Veterans that allows our arm of influence to reach even further,” said Jessica.</p>\n<p>The We Honor Veterans program provides five levels of recognition to organizations that demonstrate a commitment to improving care for veterans. Aside from existing partner requirements, Level Five partners place a greater emphasis on staff education and caring for Vietnam-era and combat Veterans. Additionally, Level Five partners take on the role of regional mentor to other We Honor Veterans partners working to enhance their programs.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>“When we set out to create the Level Five program we knew that it had to be different to truly showcase the efforts needed to go above and beyond. Not only has the Heartland Hospice team demonstrated their commitment, but they have helped shape the program and have continued as an example of what all hospice partners should strive to be,” said NHPCO President &amp; CEO Edo Banach.</p>\n<p>To learn more about the We Honor Veterans initiative, the steps that our agencies have taken to receive this acknowledgement or to see where other Heartland agencies are at in the process of achieving this honor, visit the <a rel=\"noopener\" href=\"http://www.wehonorveterans.org\" target=\"_blank\">We Honor Veterans website</a>.</p>\n\n\n                </div>\n            </div>        </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n                </div>\n    </div>\n\n\n\t                  <a class=\"close-icon popup_heartlan2_close\">\n\t                    <img src=\"/css/images/x-close-navy.svg\" alt=\"close-icon\">\n\t                </a>\n\t            "

TobyMac is her favorite Christian musician and she wanted to splurge on tickets that were close to the stage. Unfortunately, Gayle is battling cancer and as of recently the disease is making it difficult for her to walk longer distances. The great seats she had were not handicap accessible and she was worried she might have to miss her favorite musician’s concert.</p>\n<p>Upon hearing Gayle’s devastating news, Heartland Hospice stepped in and mobilized their team to help her attend the concert. The Heartland social worker called the Ted Constant Convocation Center (The Ted) to see if there were any handicap accessible seats available, in which there were, but the seats were further away from the stage.</p>\n<p>The Heartland team did not want to diminish the experience for Gayle, so they launched a social media campaign to the arena and to TobyMac’s team. The message was quickly received because Heartland’s Manager of Business Development was contacted by The Ted who told them, “Heartland must love their patients, you have no idea how many emails and calls we’ve received to help this patient.” The Ted promised to figure out a way to make Gayle’s existing seats work.</p>\n<p>Soon after hearing the exciting news from The Ted, TobyMac’s team reached out to Heartland and provided backstage meet and greet passes for Gayle and her family. To make the evening more special, local real estate agent, Chris “Limo Agent” Susko with exp Realty, donated limousine services to take her in style to the concert.</p>\n<p>Not only was Gayle able to meet her favorite artist, enjoy her amazing seats, her heart’s desire to meet TobyMacy was fulfilled. She told the Heartland team “I just want to meet TobyMac before I go home.”</p>\n\n\n                            \n    \n    <img src=\"/media/8334/2.jpg\" class=\"responsiveImg\">\n\n\n                </div>\n            </div>        </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n                </div>\n    </div>\n\n\n\t                  <a class=\"close-icon popup_heartlan4_close\">\n\t                    <img src=\"/css/images/x-close-navy.svg\" alt=\"close-icon\">\n\t                </a>\n\t            "

Here are some excerpts from Heather’s letter:</p>\n<p>“Six months ago, Andrea walked through my door and my life was forever changed. I was so frightened to know that hospice would now be taking care of my dad. Hospice, to me, meant the end. Little did I know that it was really the beginning of an incredible journey...</p>\n<p>“Andrea is really a doctor in nurse’s clothing. She managed my dad’s health like no other nurse I had ever seen. She took such a load off my shoulders and gave me the opportunity to be my dad’s daughter again and not just his caregiver.</p>\n<p>“Stephanie came in three times a week humming little tunes and sharing stories with my dad. She is such a gem and truly a gift from God to be able to do what she does.</p>\n<p>“Kathy would come in laughing and joking with Dad and he always enjoyed chatting with her on a personal level. He would often give her advice and it made Dad feel so important to just know that someone valued his opinion.</p>\n<p>“Daryl, Scott and Dave took my dad places I could have never taken him. Dad had so much to come to terms with and thanks to these three wonderful men, he was able to make peace with something horrific that had happened in Vietnam. My whole life I saw him have flashbacks of the war and he encountered many sleepless nights. In his final days, he came to terms with what happened and forgave himself. Finally, a peace came over him.</p>\n<p>“As his daughter, there is no possible way for me to express my gratitude for what you did for my daddy. When he passed, he was at peace...”</p>\n\n\n                </div>\n            </div>        </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n                </div>\n    </div>\n\n\n\t                  <a class=\"close-icon popup_heartlan1_close\">\n\t                    <img src=\"/css/images/x-close-navy.svg\" alt=\"close-icon\">\n\t                </a>\n\t            "

We would like to thank our local leadership team, co-workers, veteran volunteers and of course the veterans for which all of this is possible,” added Sarah.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The We Honor Veterans program provides four levels of recognition to organizations that demonstrate a commitment to improving care for veterans. In order to reach Level Four, Heartland was tasked with learning more about caring for veterans, declaring a commitment to honoring veterans at the end of life, providing education for hospice staff and volunteers on caring for veterans and partnering with the VA at the local, regional and national level to ensure the unique needs of veterans are met.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>To learn more about the We Honor Veterans initiative, the steps that our agencies have taken to receive this acknowledgement or to see where other Heartland agencies are at in the process of achieving this honor, <a href=\"http://www.wehonorveterans.org\" target=\"_blank\">click here</a>.</p>\n\n\n                </div>\n            </div>        </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n                </div>\n    </div>\n\n\n\t                  <a class=\"close-icon popup_heartlan2_close\">\n\t                    <img src=\"/css/images/x-close-navy.svg\" alt=\"close-icon\">\n\t                </a>\n\t            "

He had recently begun receiving services from a different hospice provider. When the couple inquired about getting him fluids, they were told that option was not available. I explained to her Heartland has a different philosophy and that IV fluids were something we could absolutely do and would support, if that was what they wanted. After a lengthy discussion, she gave me permission to contact her physician. The physician was reluctant to change services, thinking it was best to stay with the current hospice provider. In the meantime, the woman had taken the patient to the hospital for IV fluids, and as a result, the other hospice discharged him from their service. We immediately called the physician and our nurse was able to admit the patient the next day. I had already called Heartland Pharmacy so that we could be proactive and make sure IV fluids would be on hand at their home and ready for the next time. This would prevent them from having to go to the hospital again.\n\n“The patient’s wish was to not die at home; he did not want his family to have that memory. To honor his wish, we helped coordinate his admission to a local nursing facility. Although he was declining rapidly, he also had one last wish to marry his girlfriend before he passed away. We rushed to plan a wedding in less than 24 hours. Our Volunteer Coordinator was the photographer, our Bereavement Coordinator was present at the ceremony, and our nurse helped coordinate the flowers, while the facility helped find a dress for the bride. They were married the next day.\n\n“This story truly shows how much Heartland’s philosophy makes a difference. I am so thankful that we had the opportunity to be a part of this beautiful story.”</blockquote>\n    \n\n\n                </div>\n            </div>        </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n                </div>\n    </div>\n\n\n\t                  <a class=\"close-icon popup_whyheart3_close\">\n\t                    <img src=\"/css/images/x-close-navy.svg\" alt=\"close-icon\">\n\t                </a>\n\t            "

It was a bit of a whirlwind for us, as it appeared she would be in long-term care first. Amber was our weekend nurse and she was wonderful. She treated all of us, most importantly my bride, with love and respect. Jessica was our weekday nurse. She went well beyond what I expected. Her knowledge of nursing, her level of professional care and her love for her patients and family is nothing short of remarkable.</em></p>\n<p><em>While we were receiving care from Heartland - every nurse, staff and chaplain were all above what I expected. I also really appreciate the follow-up care.</em></p>\n<p><em>I have been in full-time pastoral ministry for 24 years.

In the letter below, Dawn, the daughter of a hospice patient, expresses her gratitude to the Heartland Hospice Serving Northern Michigan team for&nbsp;the care they provided to her mother while at home at the end-of-life.</span></p>\n<p>Dear Heartland Hospice,</p>\n<p>I've been thinking of writing for a while now, and with the recent survey I completed, I realized it was time I actually put that desire into action. You provided care and support to my mother, Gretchen, August through October 2016. I want to express our immense gratitude for making it possible for the ending of her life to be spent here at home with me, with all the comfort and peace of mind that only being at home provides. To have this without having to sacrifice the professional care and oversight she needed, and to pass those days in comfort and without debilitating pain, is a gift beyond measure.</p>\n<p>Regardless of 'area of responsibility,' every member of your staff we came in contact with performed their work with excellence. Every concern, question or need was&nbsp;<strong>always&nbsp;</strong>quickly, conscientiously and effectively handled and all follow-through and communication were consistently top-notch. Your office staff was wonderful.</p>\n<p>Our nurse, Hannah, was all that one could hope for in both personal qualities and professional expertise, as was Kim, our aide. They brought us their professional knowledge, expertise and experience, but also genuine respect, kindness and humor. Always attending to and understanding the physical challenges that were present, they never lost sight of the fact that this was a&nbsp;<strong>person&nbsp;</strong>they were caring for. This wonderful blend of professional and personal in our interactions always provided a positive uplift to our spirits. We love them both!</p>\n<p>Lastly, I'd like to mention the following, as it was of great importance to me and one of the major strengths of working with Heartland Hospice, and Hannah in particular. In sorting out the best plan or response to meet challenges that came up, my feelings, opinions and observations were always welcomed, listened to and valued. Together, we came up with the best response for Mom's care. I have great respect for Hannah professionally and am so grateful for her receptivity to a collaborative effort. Mom and I had truly desired this and it gave us both peace of mind and comfort. Hannah's attention to every detail and follow-through was stellar.</p>\n<p>Amber was on duty when Mom passed and she too was wonderful in her demeanor and handling of Mom and the necessary details. I'm so glad she was the one on duty that day. The support she gave was just perfect.</p>\n<p>In closing, I would like to say that the passing of my mom and the time proceeding would have been so much more painful and difficult for us both to have gone through had it not been for Heartland Hospice and your wonderful staff. Because of the quality of people you employ throughout your organization, our experience was outstanding and I have nothing but praise for the support and care given to Mom and myself. I shall&nbsp;<strong>always</strong> remember and be grateful.</p>\n<p>With the warmest of regards,</p>\n<p>Dawn</p>\n\n\n                </div>\n            </div>        </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n                </div>\n    </div>\n\n\n\t                  <a class=\"close-icon popup_daughter3_close\">\n\t                    <img src=\"/css/images/x-close-navy.svg\" alt=\"close-icon\">\n\t                </a>\n\t            "

Amber Price, Music Therapist with Heartland Hospice, shared her experience of connecting through music following the restrictions to visit with her patients.</p>\n<p>“As a music therapist, the thing I love most about my job is the connection I am able to make with my patients and their families through music. Music evokes memories, calms the spirit and assists in symptom management amongst so many other possibilities.”</p>\n<p>“Since the novel coronavirus restrictions have greatly limited my ability to see patients, I wanted to do everything I could to still keep that connection alive. Before we were able to do virtual visits, I reached out to the facilities that I frequented and asked if they would be interested in YouTube videos for their residents to follow along to with lyric sheets. I got positive feedback from these facilities and created short YouTube videos with different genres of music in each and sent them to the facilities that I had reached out to. As the weather here in Chicago has become somewhat more tolerable, I have again reached out to those same facilities to see if I would be able to play music in the courtyards with the windows open, so my patients and the other residents are still able to have that connection to music. This is an option we are currently exploring.”</p>\n<p>“It has been a game changer once virtual visits became available. During my first virtual visit, I thought I was going to cry as I was so overcome with emotion seeing my patient recognize me and my voice despite having dementia. Knowing that the power of music can fight through these bleak times has given me and the families of my patients hope that there still is a lot to look forward to. I am greatly appreciative of the nurses that have taken the time to utilize this option with me when I know they are busy keeping themselves and the patients safe during their visits. This is the new norm for now and I will appreciate every second I am able to continue to provide even just a smile to these beautiful patients and families.”</p>\n\n\n                </div>\n            </div>        </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n                </div>\n    </div>\n\n\n\t                  <a class=\"close-icon popup_heartlan1_close\">\n\t                    <img src=\"/css/images/x-close-navy.svg\" alt=\"close-icon\">\n\t                </a>\n\t            "

We met Misty Falco, ARNP. Once Misty took over care, I must say she really went above and beyond for my dad and my family. She took calls over weekends and would always make time to talk through something going on. Misty did a great job to get information to our family about his terminal condition. I’m a 21-year nursing veteran and her care was top notch. To the point I work in post-secondary education for physician Assistant with a specialization in surgery. Palliative care is something that is not talked about enough. Misty is a great resource for providers here in Wichita and the surrounding areas.</p>\n<p>Last week, we had to make the pivot to hospice. We were met with Nikki to go over all the hospice requirements, resources and so on. Nikki was amazing to work with and helped us have a better understanding of hospice. She immediately discussed my dad’s condition with the medical director and just as she said she would, she called us back with updates to help keep my dad comfortable. We also met Dad’s nurse, Julie, last week. The care and compassion she showed meant a lot for the family. She came in, took her time to really have a good idea of what would be needed and ensured further updates were done and followed up with right away. I just don’t have enough good things to say about everyone we worked with. I’m looking forward to the additional help with the social worker and follow-up care team as well.</p>\n<p>Yesterday morning my dad passed away. Julie was 2nd on-call and we happened to get ahold of her, and she hopped in her car and drove straight to Wichita from her home to be with Dad. My dad had said after he met her last week, ‘he had a good feeling about her’. Yesterday he was aware, but just wouldn’t wake up. As soon as he knew all of his family was around and also learned Julie was there, he relaxed a bit, laid back and took his last breath. It’s my belief he knew everyone was there and we were all okay for him to go ahead and let go and be in a better place.</p>\n<p>Again, I just want all of ProMedica, ProMedica Palliative Care and ProMedica Hospice Serving Wichita, to know the care that was delivered meant so much to our family. We are thankful for everyone that was involved in his care. I do hope this gets shared with the team, so they all know what impact they have made on us. I also hope this makes it to ProMedica leadership, so they know the services in Wichita, KS is doing right by the community as it grows.</p>\n<p>Thank you for all you do!</p>\n<p>Logan Threet</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n                </div>\n            </div>        </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n                </div>\n    </div>\n\n\n\t                  <a class=\"close-icon popup_sonthank1_close\">\n\t                    <img src=\"/css/images/x-close-navy.svg\" alt=\"close-icon\">\n\t                </a>\n\t            "

When that compassion reaches our patients’ families, that's when we know we have truly lived out our Mission. Heartland Hospice serving Wichita recently received a testimonial from Sonja, the daughter of hospice patient Mary Beth, citing the compassionate care Heartland provides to Mary Beth and the family:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“Mom was recently receiving home health care from Heartland before going to the hospital. Once she left the hospital and completed post-hospital rehabilitation, the decision was made for her to receive hospice care. Mom wanted to stay with Heartland because she trusted them. It’s great that Heartland offers both home health and hospice care within one agency. Heartland has done a phenomenal job. Whenever I call them, our needs are immediately met and I do not need to continue to make follow-up phone calls, and I greatly appreciate that. I trust things will happen in a timely manner and the Heartland team will uphold their promises! Mom and I appreciate everything the Heartland teams have done for us and she really likes her nurse, Lynette. It is great to have comfort and peace of mind. Having Heartland Hospice care for Mom allows her to be at home and comfortable. She is able to see her grandchildren, her friends and family, and she is able to cherish memories with all of her loved ones.” – <em><strong>Sonja, Mary Beth’s Daughter</strong></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n                </div>\n            </div>        </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n                </div>\n    </div>\n\n\n\t                  <a class=\"close-icon popup_motheran2_close\">\n\t                    <img src=\"/css/images/x-close-navy.svg\" alt=\"close-icon\">\n\t                </a>\n\t            "

The parade came back stronger than ever after taking a 2-year pause due to COVID-19. The Mount Joy parade has become the largest and best-known Memorial Day parade in Lancaster County.&nbsp;With its origin in the late 1800s, it has a long tradition of providing a fitting remembrance to those men and women who sacrificed their lives for the freedoms which we enjoy.</p>\n<p>The ProMedica employees that attended the parade were Stephenie Canlas, skilled nursing and rehabilitation administrator, Christy Trump, hospice administrator, Kimberly Brewer, hospice account liaison, and Sherry Harmon, hospice account liaison. The team decorated a trailer with patriotic stars and stripes along with a banner thanking all veterans for their service. The employees and their family members threw candy, poppy flowers and other items to the crowds along the parade route. This was not only a beautiful day for the parade, but a collaborative moment to honor our nation’s veterans and their families.</p>\n<p>Stephenie shared, “It was a beautiful day to remember our fallen heroes and celebrate our community’s strength. I was honored to participate with the ProMedica Hospice team.”</p>\n<p>Christy stated, “I love being part of an organization that recognizes those who have sacrificed so much for our freedoms. As a level 5 partner with We Honor Veterans, it was a privilege to walk the streets, shake the hands and thank the Veterans in our community.&nbsp;Thanks to all who helped to organize and participate in a successful event! We certainly are better together!”</p>\n\n\n                </div>\n            </div>        </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n    <div>\n        <div class=\"container\">\n        <div class=\"row clearfix\">\n            <div class=\"span4 col\">\n                <div style=\"width: 100%;\">\n                            \n    \n    <img src=\"/media/11573/parade-1.jpg\" class=\"responsiveImg\">\n\n\n                </div>\n            </div>            <div class=\"span4 col\">\n                <div style=\"width: 100%;\">\n                            \n    \n    <img src=\"/media/11578/parade-6.jpg\" class=\"responsiveImg\">\n\n\n                </div>\n            </div>            <div class=\"span4 col\">\n                <div style=\"width: 100%;\">\n                            \n    \n    <img src=\"/media/11574/parade-2.jpg\" class=\"responsiveImg\">\n\n\n                </div>\n            </div>        </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n    <div>\n        <div class=\"container\">\n        <div class=\"row clearfix\">\n            <div class=\"span6 col\">\n                <div style=\"width: 100%;\">\n                            \n    \n    <img src=\"/media/11579/parade-7.jpg\" class=\"responsiveImg\">\n\n\n                </div>\n            </div>            <div class=\"span6 col\">\n                <div style=\"width: 100%;\">\n                            \n    \n    <img src=\"/media/11577/parade-5.jpg\" class=\"responsiveImg\">\n\n\n                </div>\n            </div>        </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n                </div>\n    </div>\n\n\n\t                  <a class=\"close-icon popup_promedic1_close\">\n\t                    <img src=\"/css/images/x-close-navy.svg\" alt=\"close-icon\">\n\t                </a>\n\t            "

Through VCP, over twenty-five organizations have been meeting with the mission of ‘working together on behalf of veterans to provide access to care and support services of the Veterans Administration and in the community.’</p>\n<p>&nbsp;Each month we meet to talk about topics of concern related to veterans and their families and to ensure we understand the current needs of veterans. Educational presentations encourage us to have deeper insights into veterans so that we can share veteran concerns with our own team.</p>\n<p>The We Honor Veterans initiative has been such a powerful tool in helping veterans recognize that their sacrifice and service to our country still matter. As part of our ProMedica veteran’s outreach, I was privileged to meet with a group of veterans a few years ago. They were lamenting that, at times, they felt their service had been in vain. As we continued the conversation, it was noted that even in our changing society, people have unprecedented freedoms in the United States because of their military service.</p>\n<p>At one Veteran pinning event where we welcome home and honor veterans for their service, an employee of the facility was in the back of the community room listening. A co-worker approached him and ask if he had served. He was reluctant to speak but did share about his tour in Vietnam. He said that he never received a ‘Welcome Home’ when he returned because of the clamor surrounding the war in Vietnam. He had hidden his service because of the ridicule and violence he endured whenever people found out he served in Vietnam. We honored him that night and gave him a proper and fitting ‘Welcome Home’.</p>\n<p>This is why I find such joy and fulfillment in working with veterans. They have real and very deep needs. Our efforts to touch their lives help them to find peace, and rest, as the bugle call ‘Taps’ communicates, ‘All is well, safely rest, God is nigh.’”</p>\n<p>To learn more about the Lebanon Veteran Community Partnership, <a rel=\"noopener\" href=\"https://www.va.gov/HEALTHPARTNERSHIPS/updates/vcp/04252022.asp\" target=\"_blank\">click here</a>.</p>\n\n\n                </div>\n            </div>        </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n                </div>\n    </div>\n\n\n\t                  <a class=\"close-icon popup_promedic2_close\">\n\t                    <img src=\"/css/images/x-close-navy.svg\" alt=\"close-icon\">\n\t                </a>\n\t            "

At the time, Harold was a member of Battery B, 285<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;Field Artillery Observation Battalion, which was ambushed by a tough German SS unit just a day after the Battle of the Bulge began.&nbsp;He recalled exact details of his experience on the day of the massacre, including being rounded up as a prisoner of war only to experience one of the most notorious war crimes of World War II. He watched comrades to the right and left being shot. He even spent hours face-down in the snow to appear dead. He had a second close call later at a café where there was an additional attack.&nbsp;Eighty-seven of his fellow American troops were killed in the massacre that day. To honor them, each year he places eighty-seven American flags in his yard on the Fourth of July, Memorial Day and Veteran’s Day.</p>\n<p>His family also shared stories of his local fireworks and flag displays as well as photos taken with former President Donald Trump.

My deepest gratitude to the entire team at Heartland Hospice.\"</blockquote>\n    \n\n\n                            \n    \n<p><img id=\"__mcenew\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" src=\"/media/6020/caregiver-award.jpg?width=359&amp;height=478\" alt=\"\" width=\"359\" height=\"478\" rel=\"12038\" data-id=\"12038\"></p>\n\n\n                </div>\n            </div>        </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n                </div>\n    </div>\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t                </section>\n\t\t\t\t              <a class=\"close-icon popup_daughter1_close\">\n\t\t\t\t                <img src=\"/css/images/x-close-navy.svg\" alt=\"close-icon\">\n\t\t\t\t            </a>\n\t\t\t\t        "

The other morning the wife called me with a completely different perspective of hospice and the care they provide.

The wife was distraught and not very clear. I was asked to visit this patient and his family first before going to my other appointments.” &nbsp;</p>\n<p>When Tina arrived the patient was in pain, struggling to breath and very scared. She gave him his medicine and made him comfortable in his bed. “I told him that I would be with him as long as he needed me. I sat at his bedside at eye level and told him, <em>just look at me</em>,” explained Tina.</p>\n<p>Tina continued to talk quietly to the patient while holding his hand and keeping him calm. At one point, he spoke two words to her, “thank you.” His family later told Tina those were the first words he had spoken in the last few days. She never left his bedside and was with him as he took his last breath. Tina explains, “He comforted me just as much as I comforted him. He also reminded me that sometimes schedules and plans are not the most important part of my job.”</p>\n<p>“I firmly believe we are put exactly where we are meant to be and I was supposed to be there with him. Death is as much a part of life as being born. Someone transitioning deserves the same love and compassion as a new baby entering the world. This patient shared his last hours of life with me. That is truly the highest honor and privilege I could ever hope for,” added Tina.</p>\n\n\n                </div>\n            </div>        </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n                </div>\n    </div>\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t                </section>\n\t\t\t\t              <a class=\"close-icon popup_beingthe4_close\">\n\t\t\t\t                <img src=\"/css/images/x-close-navy.svg\" alt=\"close-icon\">\n\t\t\t\t            </a>\n\t\t\t\t        "

She was told by her doctors that she only had three weeks to live, so she opted to return home after staying in a rehabilitation center.</p>\n<p>In April, she chose ProMedica Hospice Care and when talking with her caregivers she told them her only wish was to be able to celebrate Gary’s birthday on June 20th. Gary and Beth had previous conversations about marriage and when Gary found out Beth’s last wish, he wanted to have their wedding on his birthday. The ProMedica Hospice team got to work right away to make both Beth and Gary’s wish come true.</p>\n<p>Beth had always dreamed of getting married on the beach, being barefoot and feeling the sand between her toes. Upon hearing of Beth’s dream, the ProMedica team was able to reserve a spot at Maumee Bay State Park which has a beach close enough for Beth to travel to. Beth made all of the decorations for the wedding along with her bouquet. At Maumee Bay, Gary and the ProMedica team decorated the gazebo.</p>\n<p>It was a true team effort to make Beth and Gary’s dream wedding perfect! Tim Strachan, volunteer coordinator, worked with Wixey’s Bakery for their wedding cake and he delivered it to the location. He was also able to arrange a room for the night at the lodge for the new happy couple. Angela Williams, RN case manager, found a photographer to capture the couples’ special day and Terri Wilcox, RN case manager, made sure all the decorations made it to the ceremony. Dana Vore, office manager, and Jennifer Wilson, social worker, picked up the food for the reception from Shorty’s Back 40 that was provided thanks to the ProMedica Foundation.</p>\n<p>It was a beautiful sunny day for a wedding. ProMedica Hospice chaplain, Mike, performed the ceremony. Everyone watched as Beth walked down the aisle barefoot and all smiles upon seeing Gary under the beautifully decorated gazebo. Beth and Gary couldn’t be happier with their wedding and look forward to spending their time together as husband and wife.</p>\n\n\n                </div>\n            </div>        </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n                </div>\n    </div>\n\n\n\t                  <a class=\"close-icon popup_promedic1_close\">\n\t                    <img src=\"/css/images/x-close-navy.svg\" alt=\"close-icon\">\n\t                </a>\n\t            "

The free bereavement day camp features therapeutic activities, arts and crafts and team building exercises led by a team of professional counselors, hospice team members and trained volunteers. Children explore issues related to the impact that loss can have on their lives in a safe and supportive atmosphere.</p>\n<p>Ava, Kaiah and Kali Duncan shared photos of their mom with other campers at Camp Fearless. “Our mom passed away when we were really little. We’ve been doing really fun projects, some just for us and some for our lost loved one,” said Ava. “It makes you feel better,” said Kali. “It makes you feel like, happy. Not sad or anything,” said Kaiah. The girls lost their mom about eight years ago and have been going to Camp Fearless the past three summers.</p>\n<p>Camp Fearless is offered in a number of communities across northwest Ohio and Southeast Michigan during the summer. The theme for camp this year is “Growing in Grief” in which the kids are making pop bottle planters and piecing broken pots back together. “Our goal is to teach them healthy coping skills so that they can move forward in their adventures in life,” said Kelly Macy, ProMedica Hospice Social Worker.</p>\n<p>Through the activities; volunteers and camp leaders encourage the kids to find different ways to cope with their emotions and let them out. The camp leaders notice a true transformation. “They’re really awesome kids and how they come from being afraid to walk in the doors, to being best friends with people by the time they leave,” said Kelly.</p>\n<p>The program also provides an opportunity for parents and guardians to meet individually with camp leaders to discuss the individual needs of the children and family following loss. Hospice staff provides information and connects families with additional resources to help children continue to grow and move forward on their grief journey.</p>\n<p><a rel=\"noopener\" href=\"https://www.wtol.com/article/news/camp-fearless-helps-grieving-children/512-589bb97c-4661-4704-be62-1bed604e9f35\" target=\"_blank\">WTOL Story and Video</a></p>\n\n\n                </div>\n            </div>        </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n    <div>\n        <div class=\"container\">\n        <div class=\"row clearfix\">\n            <div class=\"span6 col\">\n                <div style=\"width: 100%;\">\n                            \n    \n    <img src=\"/media/8811/hands.jpg\" class=\"responsiveImg\">\n\n\n                </div>\n            </div>            <div class=\"span6 col\">\n                <div style=\"width: 100%;\">\n                            \n    \n    <img src=\"/media/8812/ava-kaiah-kali-2.jpg\" class=\"responsiveImg\">\n\n\n                </div>\n            </div>        </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n    <div>\n        <div class=\"container\">\n        <div class=\"row clearfix\">\n            <div class=\"span6 col\">\n                <div style=\"width: 100%;\">\n                            \n    \n    <img src=\"/media/8816/day-1-morning-activity-16.jpg\" class=\"responsiveImg\">\n\n\n                </div>\n            </div>            <div class=\"span6 col\">\n                <div style=\"width: 100%;\">\n                            \n    \n    <img src=\"/media/8810/crafts.jpg\" class=\"responsiveImg\">\n\n\n                </div>\n            </div>        </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n                </div>\n    </div>\n\n\n\t                  <a class=\"close-icon popup_promedic3_close\">\n\t                    <img src=\"/css/images/x-close-navy.svg\" alt=\"close-icon\">\n\t                </a>\n\t            "

The anger and bitterness welled up a few months after she died, after the phone stopped ringing, after people stopped asking, after old friends disappeared.</p>\n<p>An Episcopal priest friend of mine and I were having a drink one night, and in response to the obligatory “How are you?” question, I started whining how old friends were no longer around. There were no more dinner invitations, no more phone calls. When we were a couple we enjoyed a busy social life. But now, well, no more. Why?</p>\n<p>Terry thought for a moment, chuckled, then said, “That’s easy, we all liked her a lot more than we do you!” We laughed, but his humor made sense to me. I remember friends saying they didn’t call because they didn’t know what to say. In my mind they didn’t have to say a word, but it would have been wonderful if they had called. I suspect that some dinner invitations stopped because they were afraid I might not be ready. They didn’t realize that I felt shunned because they didn’t know how to deal with a suddenly single person in their married world.</p>\n<p>As I read these words now, they sound harsh. But I’ve found that my experience is not unusual, and my reaction has been echoed by others in the same situation.</p>\n<p>I have fond memories of those friends who did call or stopped by. Often they would just sit and listen. We would reflect together and usually laugh as we remembered the fun times. They were quick to admit they didn’t know how I felt, because they were not in the same place. But they were helping me heal.</p>\n<p>One friend in particular would include me as part of Sunday dinners with her family. Sitting at their table and sharing their life was incredibly healing and a lifeline in a way. I will never forget that time together.</p>\n<p>When you reach out to a friend who has lost a loved one, be it a spouse, child, family member, friend, or even a pet they were particularly close to, just remember all you have to do is be there for them. Sit. Listen. Hold their hand. Don’t tell them you know how they feel, because you don’t. But do tell them there is normalcy waiting for them, when they are ready again.</p>\n<p>Just be a friend.</p>\n<p><em><a rel=\"noopener\" href=\"https://balance.hcr-manorcare.com/blog-posts/promedica-hospice-volunteer-a-profound-privilege/\" target=\"_blank\">Chuck Owen</a> is a Sylvania, Ohio, resident and has been a hospice volunteer at ProMedica Ebeid Hospice Residence since 2013.

I don’t think I ever felt as alone as I did those first few months. There was a terrible numbness about my world. Although I was surrounded by loving family and good friends, the emptiness was always present.</p>\n<p>A few weeks after my wife died, I returned to work but dreaded Friday afternoons as I would hear coworkers discussing their weekend plans. I remember the gut wrenching bitterness as I walked into what was our home at the end of the workday, to the terrible quiet. I’m sure my dog sensed the situation as he never left my side. His presence helped, but I was at the bottom.</p>\n<blockquote>\"It takes a great deal of introspection to try to identify who you are as a single person again.\"</blockquote>\n<p>I discovered it takes time. It takes a great deal of introspection to try to identify who you are as a single person again; no longer part of a couple. Everyone heals at their own speed and I needed to start thinking in terms of years, rather than months.</p>\n<p>Now as I work with hospice patients and family members coming to terms with circumstances they’re facing, I find that most patients are at the acceptance stage. Early on I was surprised by the gentle humor I found in quiet conversations with many patients when we were alone. While I suspect it’s a defense mechanism, it seems to serve them well in their final days. Although they understand, other patients display an occasional flash of anger, due to fears their family members may not cope well.</p>\n<p>As a survivor you need to continually remember you are going through a process. Never be afraid to reach out to friends and family. While their presence and relationships are vital, some may encourage you to “get on with your life.” As well-intentioned as they may be, those words may not be helpful. You need to heal at your own speed.</p>\n<p>Find an established support group through hospice, your church or medical professional. One benefit you may find is that you’re surrounded by others experiencing the same emotions you are. Some will be behind you in your journey and others will be ahead of you but can provide a great sense of understanding. Rest assured, you won’t be walking into a room filled with doom and gloom. You’ll most likely be amazed at the humor and laughter you’ll encounter as everyone shares fond memories and funny stories.</p>\n<p>Your journey is yours. Embrace it, heal, and when it’s time you’ll have the opportunity to return the support to those on their own journey.</p>\n<p><em><a rel=\"noopener\" href=\"https://balance.hcr-manorcare.com/blog-posts/promedica-hospice-volunteer-a-profound-privilege/\" target=\"_blank\">Chuck Owen</a> is a Sylvania, Ohio, resident and has been a hospice volunteer with ProMedica Hospice since 2013.

Just the type of father or grandfather you'd be proud to have. A faithful volunteer with ProMedica Hospice since 2013, Chuck spends most of his time at ProMedica Ebeid Hospice Residence but also makes house calls when needed.</p>\n<p>Born and raised in Fort Wayne, Ind, Chuck was an engineer by trade but also studied for the priesthood for two years. He and his wife, Madeline, put down deep roots in upstate New York where they raised three children.</p>\n<p>With deep reflection, Chuck looks at his volunteering for hospice as repayment for the care his wife received while she was battling leukemia. She spent 243 days in Miami Valley Hospital in Dayton some 20 years ago. The facility was small and didn't offer hospice services so the hospital staff became the Owen's end-of-life care team. Chuck fondly recalls the relationships he and his wife built there, some of which he continues to maintain today.</p>\n<p>Quick to express the benefits he receives from volunteering, he explains that it is an unfair trade. \"It's rewarding to make a difference in someone's life. It feels like a selfish profession because we get far more than we can possibly give. We can take care of their pain, offer comfort, friendship, and laughter; but patients teach us about love, acceptance, calm, incredible strength and courage.\"</p>\n<p>Chuck is always ready with a joke and often brings a sense of normalcy to the turmoil patients and families go through. Winston Churchill once said, \"When you make someone laugh, you give them a little vacation.\" Humor was important to Chuck and his wife so he uses it to help relieve tension in very stressful situations.</p>\n<p>Some might think that volunteering for hospice is depressing but Chuck sees it differently. \"Sure, we cry every once in a while because we're losing friends. You become reflective. It's something that's ahead of every one of us so let's deal with it as best we can. I see it as a profound privilege.\"</p>\n<p>And while the desire to be near his daughter and grandsons originally brought Chuck to Toledo, his work at hospice gives him another reason to stay. \"Patients change me as much as I change them. I just want to help carry on their legacy by telling their stories.\"<br></p>\n\n\n                </div>\n            </div>        </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n                </div>\n    </div>\n\n\n\t                  <a class=\"close-icon popup_promedic4_close\">\n\t                    <img src=\"/css/images/x-close-navy.svg\" alt=\"close-icon\">\n\t                </a>\n\t            "

The bereavement camp features therapeutic activities, arts and crafts and team-building exercises led by a team of professional counselors, hospice team members and trained volunteers. Children explore issues related to the impact that loss can have on their lives in a safe and supportive atmosphere. ProMedica Hospice team members provide information and connect families with additional resources to help children continue to grow and move forward on their grief journey.</p>\n<p>Hospice volunteers take on many different roles, from supporting hospice patients, families and the hospice care team, to volunteering their time at events to help the community. For Camp Fearless, the volunteers receive standard training along with grief training for children. ProMedica Hospice Serving Monroe and Lenawee Counties had 17 volunteers which included social workers from local schools, community service agencies, bereavement specialists from local funeral homes, volunTEENS and the current hospice volunteers at the agency. The Monroe agency has also been fortunate to partner with Gabby’s Grief Center for the past several years.</p>\n<p>Volunteers help our campers with crafts and activities to encourage memory share of their loved one. Camp also includes fun group activities such as relay races, water fun and more which kept our volunteers on their toes, while reminding our campers that it is ok to have fun. The volunteers work with the campers through each process, sharing laughs and some tears. Camp Fearless is successful because of the support from our volunteers!</p>\n\n\n                            \n    \n    <img src=\"/media/11659/img_4189.jpg\" class=\"responsiveImg\">\n\n\n                </div>\n            </div>        </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n                </div>\n    </div>\n\n\n\t                  <a class=\"close-icon popup_promedic1_close\">\n\t                    <img src=\"/css/images/x-close-navy.svg\" alt=\"close-icon\">\n\t                </a>\n\t            "

One of the ways patients are supported is through the Vet-to-Vet volunteer program where a veteran volunteer provides support to veteran patients. Jeri, volunteer coordinator, tells about a recent Veteran’s Day experience and the impact Ray Maliszewski, veteran volunteer, has made on the ProMedica team:</p>\n<p>“Ray has been a volunteer since 2017. In his service as a veteran volunteer, he has assisted with multiple veteran recognition ceremonies honoring veteran patients receiving hospice care. He also provided companionship visits to veterans in local facilities and was one of our veteran volunteers for the newly implemented ‘Legacy Canteen’, in which veterans gather monthly at a local facility and share stories and experiences.</p>\n<p>When Veteran’s Day was approaching and since no formal gatherings were permitted this year due to the novel coronavirus (COVID-19), I had planned to distribute stars from ‘Stars for Our Troops’ to our veteran patients, as well as our veteran volunteers.</p>\n<p>I had trouble contacting Ray and finally discovered he was a patient at ProMedica Monroe Regional Hospital. When I heard Ray was in the hospital, I knew how much this star would mean to him. With the help of Yolanda, RN liaison, and the nurses at the hospital, Ray received his star.</p>\n<p>Two days later, I received a call from Bill, a local businessman. He stated that Ray had been calling his business by mistake for the last two days trying to contact me, as Bill’s business number is similar to the hospital’s number and Ray thought the hospital could transfer the call to me. Ray told Bill his story about how he is a veteran volunteer, had just received the star and wanted to thank me for having it delivered to him. Bill recognized the importance of locating me and was able to track me down and connect me with Ray.</p>\n<p>Ray and I spoke for quite some time, sharing laughs and a few tears when he spoke of receiving the star.&nbsp; Ray said the star meant so much, especially when the nurse read the statement about where it came from.&nbsp; He told me, ‘When I get out of here, I’m going frame it.’ He also let me know he was going to be transferred to a facility for rehab the next day and would be in touch.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The following week I was notified by Ray’s granddaughter that he had taken a turn in his recovery and was sent back to the hospital on a ventilator. On November 28, Ray passed away. Ray will be dearly missed by our hospice team. We learned that even during these challenging times, the acts of many people, including the hospital staff and Bill, prove that a simple act of kindness can mean so much to so many.</p>\n<p>We are so thankful to Ray’s family for sharing him with the hospice team over the last few years. I’m also thankful to Bill, who took the time to locate me so Ray and I could have one more visit.”</p>\n\n\n                </div>\n            </div>        </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n                </div>\n    </div>\n\n\n\t                  <a class=\"close-icon popup_promedic3_close\">\n\t                    <img src=\"/css/images/x-close-navy.svg\" alt=\"close-icon\">\n\t                </a>\n\t            "

We take pride in recognizing our veteran patients with certificates, pinning ceremonies and other special ways to show our appreciation for their service on behalf of all Americans. Jeri Dushane, volunteer coordinator for ProMedica Hospice serving Monroe and Lenawee Counties details Veteran’s Day and how their normal veteran events were different this year during a pandemic.</p>\n<p>“ProMedica Hospice has been a We Honor Veteran (WHV) partner since 2011. We currently reached the Level Three partnership by our continued efforts to develop and strengthen relationships with veteran organizations, both locally and regionally. Therefore, for Veteran’s Day, we knew we needed to find a way to honor our veteran patients and veterans in the community. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>While attending a webinar as part of our WHV partnership, I heard about ‘Stars for Our Troops’.&nbsp; This volunteer group from New York takes old or tattered American flags that are retired from service and passes the legacy of the embroidered ‘stars’ to those who have defended them. Each star comes in its own bag with a small card explaining it is from an American flag that can no longer fly.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>We decided we wanted to give these to our veterans this year, along with a special quote. The quote read, ‘The U.S. flag stands for the freedom that you defended. Please accept this star, carefully prepared from a retired U.S. Flag. It is presented from a grateful nation for your service and sacrifice to defend our freedom.’</p>\n<p>Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we had to adjust our celebration plans for Veteran’s Day. ProMedica Hospice was able to honor seventeen hospice patients and three spouses of hospice patients with a star from the ‘Stars for Our Troops’ volunteer group. We also shared stars with several facilities in Monroe and Lenawee counties to distribute. A total of 100 veterans received the stars and were recognized. They were very well received and brought out many emotions from the veterans and from the team members who presented the stars.”</p>\n\n\n                            \n    \n    <img src=\"/media/9913/veterans-day-2020-2.jpg\" class=\"responsiveImg\">\n\n\n                </div>\n            </div>        </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n                </div>\n    </div>\n\n\n\t                  <a class=\"close-icon popup_promedic4_close\">\n\t                    <img src=\"/css/images/x-close-navy.svg\" alt=\"close-icon\">\n\t                </a>\n\t            "

We Honor Veterans was launched by the National Hospice and Palliative Care Organization in collaboration with the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to help improve the care veterans receive from hospice and palliative care providers.</p>\n<p>“I know the importance of ProMedica’s initiative to better serve these United States veterans,” commented Jennifer Broadway, RN, Care Transition Nurse. “I am a veteran myself, and I believe we not only care for the mind, body and spirit of our patients but that ProMedica is a hospice provider trained to care specifically for veterans,” added Jennifer.</p>\n<p>The We Honor Veterans program provides five levels of recognition to organizations that demonstrate a commitment to improving care for veterans. In order to reach Level Four, ProMedica was tasked with learning more about caring for veterans, declaring a commitment to honoring veterans at the end of life, providing education for hospice staff and volunteers on caring for veterans and partnering with the VA at the local, regional and national level to ensure the unique needs of veterans are met.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>To learn more about the We Honor Veterans initiative, the steps that our agencies have taken to receive this acknowledgment or to see where other ProMedica agencies are at in the process of achieving this honor, visit the <a rel=\"noopener\" href=\"http://www.wehonorveterans.org\" target=\"_blank\">We Honor Veterans website</a>.</p>\n\n\n                </div>\n            </div>        </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n                </div>\n    </div>\n\n\n\t                  <a class=\"close-icon popup_promedic1_close\">\n\t                    <img src=\"/css/images/x-close-navy.svg\" alt=\"close-icon\">\n\t                </a>\n\t            "

It was the strangest thing. I guess I was expecting typical hospital noises including loud conversations, call bells and intrusive intercom messages. But there was nothing but peace.</p>\n<p>A friend had planted the volunteering seed in me over a year before that initial visit. And like many good things, it took some nurturing. I thought about it a great deal, spoke with a few close friends and read up on it.</p>\n<p>Initially one of my greatest concerns was that I would end up reliving the pain and sorrow that I had successfully put behind me. I realized that I really knew very little about hospice, as my wife and I had not really been exposed to the program. But as I thought about all the negatives, I started to notice that my mind would be filled with good memories of all the kind and gentle things friends and staff had done for us during my wife’s terrible ordeal.</p>\n<p>It had taken me nearly a year to get to that point and take the first step toward getting involved in such an emotional situation. But as soon as I visited Ebeid Hospice, I realized I was ready and it was payback time.</p>\n<p>Although I’ve been a hospice volunteer for five years, I realized some time ago this is exactly where I belong. This is where I can all make a very positive difference in the lives of others who are in great pain. This is the opportunity to sit and listen, to hold a hand, to offer advice when appropriate. But more importantly, it’s the opportunity to hear what patients and families are trying to say.</p>\n<p>Do I have thoughts of the pain I went through so many years ago? Of course, but those memories are much softer now as I realize that I am making a difference.</p>\n<p><em><a rel=\"noopener\" href=\"https://balance.hcr-manorcare.com/blog-posts/promedica-hospice-volunteer-a-profound-privilege/\" target=\"_blank\">Chuck Owen</a> is a Sylvania, Ohio, resident and has been a hospice volunteer with ProMedica Hospice since 2013.

The anger and bitterness welled up a few months after she died, after the phone stopped ringing, after people stopped asking, after old friends disappeared.</p>\n<p>An Episcopal priest friend of mine and I were having a drink one night, and in response to the obligatory “How are you?” question, I started whining how old friends were no longer around. There were no more dinner invitations, no more phone calls. When we were a couple we enjoyed a busy social life. But now, well, no more. Why?</p>\n<p>Terry thought for a moment, chuckled, then said, “That’s easy, we all liked her a lot more than we do you!” We laughed, but his humor made sense to me. I remember friends saying they didn’t call because they didn’t know what to say. In my mind they didn’t have to say a word, but it would have been wonderful if they had called. I suspect that some dinner invitations stopped because they were afraid I might not be ready. They didn’t realize that I felt shunned because they didn’t know how to deal with a suddenly single person in their married world.</p>\n<p>As I read these words now, they sound harsh. But I’ve found that my experience is not unusual, and my reaction has been echoed by others in the same situation.</p>\n<p>I have fond memories of those friends who did call or stopped by. Often they would just sit and listen. We would reflect together and usually laugh as we remembered the fun times. They were quick to admit they didn’t know how I felt, because they were not in the same place. But they were helping me heal.</p>\n<p>One friend in particular would include me as part of Sunday dinners with her family. Sitting at their table and sharing their life was incredibly healing and a lifeline in a way. I will never forget that time together.</p>\n<p>When you reach out to a friend who has lost a loved one, be it a spouse, child, family member, friend, or even a pet they were particularly close to, just remember all you have to do is be there for them. Sit. Listen. Hold their hand. Don’t tell them you know how they feel, because you don’t. But do tell them there is normalcy waiting for them, when they are ready again.</p>\n<p>Just be a friend.</p>\n<p><em><a rel=\"noopener\" href=\"https://balance.hcr-manorcare.com/blog-posts/promedica-hospice-volunteer-a-profound-privilege/\" target=\"_blank\">Chuck Owen</a> is a Sylvania, Ohio, resident and has been a hospice volunteer at ProMedica Ebeid Hospice Residence since 2013.

I don’t think I ever felt as alone as I did those first few months. There was a terrible numbness about my world. Although I was surrounded by loving family and good friends, the emptiness was always present.</p>\n<p>A few weeks after my wife died, I returned to work but dreaded Friday afternoons as I would hear coworkers discussing their weekend plans. I remember the gut wrenching bitterness as I walked into what was our home at the end of the workday, to the terrible quiet. I’m sure my dog sensed the situation as he never left my side. His presence helped, but I was at the bottom.</p>\n<blockquote>\"It takes a great deal of introspection to try to identify who you are as a single person again.\"</blockquote>\n<p>I discovered it takes time. It takes a great deal of introspection to try to identify who you are as a single person again; no longer part of a couple. Everyone heals at their own speed and I needed to start thinking in terms of years, rather than months.</p>\n<p>Now as I work with hospice patients and family members coming to terms with circumstances they’re facing, I find that most patients are at the acceptance stage. Early on I was surprised by the gentle humor I found in quiet conversations with many patients when we were alone. While I suspect it’s a defense mechanism, it seems to serve them well in their final days. Although they understand, other patients display an occasional flash of anger, due to fears their family members may not cope well.</p>\n<p>As a survivor you need to continually remember you are going through a process. Never be afraid to reach out to friends and family. While their presence and relationships are vital, some may encourage you to “get on with your life.” As well-intentioned as they may be, those words may not be helpful. You need to heal at your own speed.</p>\n<p>Find an established support group through hospice, your church or medical professional. One benefit you may find is that you’re surrounded by others experiencing the same emotions you are. Some will be behind you in your journey and others will be ahead of you but can provide a great sense of understanding. Rest assured, you won’t be walking into a room filled with doom and gloom. You’ll most likely be amazed at the humor and laughter you’ll encounter as everyone shares fond memories and funny stories.</p>\n<p>Your journey is yours. Embrace it, heal, and when it’s time you’ll have the opportunity to return the support to those on their own journey.</p>\n<p><em><a rel=\"noopener\" href=\"https://balance.hcr-manorcare.com/blog-posts/promedica-hospice-volunteer-a-profound-privilege/\" target=\"_blank\">Chuck Owen</a> is a Sylvania, Ohio, resident and has been a hospice volunteer with ProMedica Hospice since 2013.

She gave him his medicine and made him comfortable in his bed. “I told him that I would be with him as long as he needed me. I sat at his bedside at eye level and told him, <em>just look at me</em>,” explained Tina.</p>\n<p>Tina continued to talk quietly to the patient while holding his hand and keeping him calm. At one point, he spoke two words to her, “thank you.” His family later told Tina those were the first words he had spoken in the last few days. She never left his bedside and was with him as he took his last breath. Tina explains, “He comforted me just as much as I comforted him. He also reminded me that sometimes schedules and plans are not the most important part of my job.”</p>\n<p>“I firmly believe we are put exactly where we are meant to be and I was supposed to be there with him. Death is as much a part of life as being born. Someone transitioning deserves the same love and compassion as a new baby entering the world. This patient shared his last hours of life with me. That is truly the highest honor and privilege I could ever hope for,” added Tina.</p>\n\n\n                </div>\n            </div>        </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n                </div>\n    </div>\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t                </section>\n\t\t\t\t              <a class=\"close-icon popup_beingthe4_close\">\n\t\t\t\t                <img src=\"/css/images/x-close-navy.svg\" alt=\"close-icon\">\n\t\t\t\t            </a>\n\t\t\t\t        "

I thought this was a great way for our team to contribute to our community and help keep the area clean. We picked up garbage along two ditches on each side of the highway as well as the median. We were out there for about two and half hours and covered 1.75 miles. Jay, Greg and Sara, account liaisons, dedicated their time and joined in on the fun cleaning up and we had a great day!

I sat at his bedside at eye level and told him, <em>just look at me</em>,” explained Tina.</p>\n<p>Tina continued to talk quietly to the patient while holding his hand and keeping him calm. At one point, he spoke two words to her, “thank you.” His family later told Tina those were the first words he had spoken in the last few days. She never left his bedside and was with him as he took his last breath. Tina explains, “He comforted me just as much as I comforted him. He also reminded me that sometimes schedules and plans are not the most important part of my job.”</p>\n<p>“I firmly believe we are put exactly where we are meant to be and I was supposed to be there with him. Death is as much a part of life as being born. Someone transitioning deserves the same love and compassion as a new baby entering the world. This patient shared his last hours of life with me.

I sat at his bedside at eye level and told him, <em>just look at me</em>,” explained Tina.</p>\n<p>Tina continued to talk quietly to the patient while holding his hand and keeping him calm. At one point, he spoke two words to her, “thank you.” His family later told Tina those were the first words he had spoken in the last few days. She never left his bedside and was with him as he took his last breath. Tina explains, “He comforted me just as much as I comforted him. He also reminded me that sometimes schedules and plans are not the most important part of my job.”</p>\n<p>“I firmly believe we are put exactly where we are meant to be and I was supposed to be there with him. Death is as much a part of life as being born. Someone transitioning deserves the same love and compassion as a new baby entering the world. This patient shared his last hours of life with me. That is truly the highest honor and privilege I could ever hope for,” added Tina.</p>\n\n\n                </div>\n            </div>        </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n                </div>\n    </div>\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t                </section>\n\t\t\t\t              <a class=\"close-icon popup_beingthe4_close\">\n\t\t\t\t                <img src=\"/css/images/x-close-navy.svg\" alt=\"close-icon\">\n\t\t\t\t            </a>\n\t\t\t\t        "

The wife was distraught and not very clear. I was asked to visit this patient and his family first before going to my other appointments.” &nbsp;</p>\n<p>When Tina arrived the patient was in pain, struggling to breath and very scared. She gave him his medicine and made him comfortable in his bed. “I told him that I would be with him as long as he needed me. I sat at his bedside at eye level and told him, <em>just look at me</em>,” explained Tina.</p>\n<p>Tina continued to talk quietly to the patient while holding his hand and keeping him calm. At one point, he spoke two words to her, “thank you.” His family later told Tina those were the first words he had spoken in the last few days. She never left his bedside and was with him as he took his last breath. Tina explains, “He comforted me just as much as I comforted him. He also reminded me that sometimes schedules and plans are not the most important part of my job.”</p>\n<p>“I firmly believe we are put exactly where we are meant to be and I was supposed to be there with him. Death is as much a part of life as being born. Someone transitioning deserves the same love and compassion as a new baby entering the world. This patient shared his last hours of life with me. That is truly the highest honor and privilege I could ever hope for,” added Tina.</p>\n\n\n                </div>\n            </div>        </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n                </div>\n    </div>\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t                </section>\n\t\t\t\t              <a class=\"close-icon popup_beingthe4_close\">\n\t\t\t\t                <img src=\"/css/images/x-close-navy.svg\" alt=\"close-icon\">\n\t\t\t\t            </a>\n\t\t\t\t        "

Specifically, I wanted to share the experience I had with one of our families. Both the patient and his wife were hesitant to sign-up for hospice because of horror stories they were told by friends and family. The other morning the wife called me with a completely different perspective of hospice and the care they provide. She went on to comment about how the level of care her husband received from Heartland was above and beyond what they expected&nbsp; or ever thought they would receive and couldn’t have been happier to have Heartland in their home.\"</p>\n<p>\"I make many referrals a week but the one referral I never question or worry about is a referral to Heartland. We will continue to use them as our primary hospice because of experiences like this. I can’t tell you how proud and happy I was to receive this phone call and know that I have an amazing care team. This family will always remember Heartland.\"</p>\n\n\n                            \n    \n    \n        <blockquote>\"I’m honored to work with such amazing individuals who are so dedicated to their calling in life – a higher quality of care.”</blockquote>\n    \n\n\n                            \n    \n<p>Laura Sterling, DNP/FNP-BC</p>\n<p>Nurse Practitioner, Arizona Oncology</p>\n\n\n                </div>\n            </div>        </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n                </div>\n    </div>\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t                </section>\n\t\t\t\t              <a class=\"close-icon popup_nursepra3_close\">\n\t\t\t\t                <img src=\"/css/images/x-close-navy.svg\" alt=\"close-icon\">\n\t\t\t\t            </a>\n\t\t\t\t        "

The wife was distraught and not very clear. I was asked to visit this patient and his family first before going to my other appointments.” &nbsp;</p>\n<p>When Tina arrived the patient was in pain, struggling to breath and very scared. She gave him his medicine and made him comfortable in his bed. “I told him that I would be with him as long as he needed me. I sat at his bedside at eye level and told him, <em>just look at me</em>,” explained Tina.</p>\n<p>Tina continued to talk quietly to the patient while holding his hand and keeping him calm. At one point, he spoke two words to her, “thank you.” His family later told Tina those were the first words he had spoken in the last few days. She never left his bedside and was with him as he took his last breath. Tina explains, “He comforted me just as much as I comforted him. He also reminded me that sometimes schedules and plans are not the most important part of my job.”</p>\n<p>“I firmly believe we are put exactly where we are meant to be and I was supposed to be there with him. Death is as much a part of life as being born. Someone transitioning deserves the same love and compassion as a new baby entering the world. This patient shared his last hours of life with me. That is truly the highest honor and privilege I could ever hope for,” added Tina.</p>\n\n\n                </div>\n            </div>        </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n                </div>\n    </div>\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t                </section>\n\t\t\t\t              <a class=\"close-icon popup_beingthe4_close\">\n\t\t\t\t                <img src=\"/css/images/x-close-navy.svg\" alt=\"close-icon\">\n\t\t\t\t            </a>\n\t\t\t\t        "
