The Linden Village campus is comprised of four one-story cottages and a central Community Center.</p>\n<p>There is also a secured courtyard for gardening and enjoying the outdoors. While bedrooms can be fully furnished, many of our residents like to bring some favorite furniture from home. The common rooms are cozy and inviting, and the furniture is comfortable. Resident families frequently use our spacious, inviting common areas during visits to the community.</p>\n<p>Our Community Center is our heart of the community with a Great Room for activities, a health center and a beauty/barber shop.</p>\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n                        ",

At Linden Village, everything in our two secured cottages - from staffing to programs to environment - has been researched, developed and designed for our residents’ specific needs. These special cottages are a welcome answer for both our residents and their families; a new caregiving alternative for the time when home care is no longer possible, but skilled nursing care is not necessary.</p>\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n                        ",

The common areas encourage the enjoyment of interaction and socialization without sacrificing safety.</p>\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n                        "
