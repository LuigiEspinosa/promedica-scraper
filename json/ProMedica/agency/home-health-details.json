After a long hospital stay, Mr. E was discharged from a long-term rehab facility and referred to Heartland Home Health Care Serving Northeast Ohio.<br />    <br />                <br />                    <br />        <br />    <br />    <br />        <br />        <br />            <br />                <br />                            <br />    <br />His physical therapist, Dale, was determined to get Mr. E out of his power chair and walking before the first hint of spring in Cleveland. Mr. E’s own goal was to be able to leave his home and eat at a restaurant under his own power. Dale made Mr. E’s goal his own goal, and together the two began an incredible journey.<br />The first step was to get Mr. E out of his chair and walking independently with a walker. Dale soon realized that underneath all that determination, Mr. E was terrified of falling. So Dale worked with Mr. E on controlled falls in a safe environment and the steps to take to get back up. Once Mr. E felt more in control, they worked on strength training and balance activities, and tackled obstacles such as navigating his home, climbing steps and getting in and out of bed. Each new success was another victory and, eventually, Dale was able to transition Mr. E to a walker.<br />Heidi, Mr. E’s occupational therapist, helps patients regain their ability to do small, but important tasks to be more independent in their daily lives. At the start, Mr. E was completely dependent on others for food preparation, dressing and basic hygiene responsibilities. But with Heidi’s help, he is now able to make his own lunch, dress himself and manage his own hygiene.<br />Dale and Heidi worked with Mr. E every week until April. To celebrate all of his accomplishments, the Heartland team took Mr. E to his favorite pizzeria. He was able to exit his home, safely get into a car and walk into the pizzeria on his own using his walker, accomplishing the goals he and his therapists had strived for.<br />                <br />                    <br />        <br />    <br />                <br />    <br />                  <a><br />                    <img src='/css/images/x-close-navy.svg' alt='close-icon' /><br />                </a><br />"

Heartland Home Health &amp; Hospice wanted to plan a fundraiser to help their community recover from the damages so the team reached out to Melanie Maraugha, Donor Relations Manager, Grants Officer with ProMedica Foundation, to find out what they could do to for a fundraiser and she informed the agency that through the Heartland Hospice Memorial Fund and ProMedica Foundation they could donate $10,000 to their community.<br />The Heartland Hospice Memorial Fund donation was distributed between Riverside Place of Midland, Great Lakes Bay Veterans Coalition and United Way of Midland County’s Rise Together Fund. When Heartland found out that Riverside Place of Midland had to immediately evacuate their residence due to the flooding, they felt it was important to help them with some of the donation funds. Heartland is also committed to serving Veterans in the community and is a partner with the We Honor Veterans Program. Kendall MacConnell, Veteran Volunteer, mentioned that he had volunteered with the Great Lakes Bay Veterans Coalition handing out food to those who were in need after the flood, the team knew this was an organization they also wanted to help. The Heartland team found out that the Great Lakes Bay Veterans Coalition matches their donations to help restore the homes of Veterans that were damaged by the flood. Another vital organization Heartland wanted to give to was the United Way of Midland County’s Rise Together Fund as they continue to help those affected by the flood.<br />Representatives from the organizations attended the check presentation that was held on July 24, 2020 at the Heartland Home Health &amp; Hospice office. Brad, Terry and Greg from the Veterans Coalition attended and shared how they helped with evacuating local residents, set-up shelters and transported food to shelters. Ashley and Lindsay from the United Way of Midland County also attended the check presentation and were very thankful to Heartland for their donation. Kim with Riverside was unable to attend the check presentation but expressed her appreciation for the donation and the support from Heartland to help restore their facility where so many seniors call home.<br />“I honestly tear up trying to put into words what it means to the Heartland team to be able to support our community. We are blessed to work within an organization that truly shares our mission of serving others and with these local organizations serving those who need help the most during this natural disaster. We are so very thankful to Melanie and the Heartland Hospice Memorial Fund for helping our agency give back to others. I feel great about working for an organization that is proven to be as they claim: Helpful, Caring and Responsive!” said Julie Rousse, Administrator.<br />                <br />                    <br />        <br />    <br />    <br />        <br />        <br />            <br />                <br />                            <br />    <br />    <img src='/media/9570/check-presentation-7-24-2020-2.jpg' /><br />                <br />                    <br />        <br />    <br />                <br />    <br />                  <a><br />                    <img src='/css/images/x-close-navy.svg' alt='close-icon' /><br />                </a><br />"

During their conversation, the patient shared that he was concerned about his dog since he was not able to let him outside while he was in the hospital. The patient also shared with Marla that he was having some anxiety over other personal matters.<br />Marla spent a lot of time with the patient and went out of her way to try to relieve some of the anxiety he was having. She asked the patient if he had anybody in mind that could check on his dog. She then contacted a friend of the patient on the patient’s behalf and asked if he would go into the home to let the dog out and check on things. Marla then followed up to make sure everything was taken care of at the patient’s home.<br />Thanks to Marla and the staff in Bay City for this “WOW” experience!<br />                <br />                    <br />        <br />    <br />                <br />    <br />                  <a><br />                    <img src='/css/images/x-close-navy.svg' alt='close-icon' /><br />                </a><br />"

I wish to compliment all the caregivers that participated in his care. From PT, I commend Zachary and Dee. From OT, I commend Heidi and Samantha. He had many nurses because he had to have INR drawn every week. Our RN was Jillian, and other nurses were Elizabeth, Jim and Brad. Keith was his extra friendly aide that took care of showers and shaving. He was invaluable. Every one of these caregivers performed their duties above and beyond the call of duty. I miss all of them.

After a long hospital stay, Mr. E was discharged from a long-term rehab facility and referred to Heartland Home Health Care Serving Northeast Ohio.<br />    <br />                <br />                    <br />        <br />    <br />    <br />        <br />        <br />            <br />                <br />                            <br />    <br />His physical therapist, Dale, was determined to get Mr. E out of his power chair and walking before the first hint of spring in Cleveland. Mr. E’s own goal was to be able to leave his home and eat at a restaurant under his own power. Dale made Mr. E’s goal his own goal, and together the two began an incredible journey.<br />The first step was to get Mr. E out of his chair and walking independently with a walker. Dale soon realized that underneath all that determination, Mr. E was terrified of falling. So Dale worked with Mr. E on controlled falls in a safe environment and the steps to take to get back up. Once Mr. E felt more in control, they worked on strength training and balance activities, and tackled obstacles such as navigating his home, climbing steps and getting in and out of bed. Each new success was another victory and, eventually, Dale was able to transition Mr. E to a walker.<br />Heidi, Mr. E’s occupational therapist, helps patients regain their ability to do small, but important tasks to be more independent in their daily lives. At the start, Mr. E was completely dependent on others for food preparation, dressing and basic hygiene responsibilities. But with Heidi’s help, he is now able to make his own lunch, dress himself and manage his own hygiene.<br />Dale and Heidi worked with Mr. E every week until April. To celebrate all of his accomplishments, the Heartland team took Mr. E to his favorite pizzeria. He was able to exit his home, safely get into a car and walk into the pizzeria on his own using his walker, accomplishing the goals he and his therapists had strived for.<br />                <br />                    <br />        <br />    <br />                <br />    <br />                <br />              <a><br />                <img src='/css/images/x-close-navy.svg' alt='close-icon' /><br />            </a><br />"

He is very motivated to take care of himself and cooks multiple times per day. Susanne, Occupational Therapist, noticed that when he cooks items, he would often burn them due to forgetfulness. She also was concerned he would leave something on the stove and possibly start a fire.<br />“Susanne could have simply recommended he purchase a timer, but she actually went and purchased an inexpensive timer for him, to help him avoid burning his food and to reduce the risk of any type of a fire. She also used duct tape to tape down cords that were stretched across his pathways, which were tripping hazards for him. She also assisted with his medication management, making it easier and simpler for him to correctly take the medication at the right times.<br />“Jeff, our Physical Therapist, observed the same patient venting frustration at his medical bills, which didn’t include an “S” at the end of his last name.  He said this has been an ongoing problem since he turned age 65: 25 years ago. Jeff asked to look at his Medicare card and noticed that the Medicare card was spelled incorrectly, yet his Social Security card had the correct spelling. Jeff then called both Medicare and Social Security offices and coordinated with them to change the patient’s name to be spelled correctly on his Medicare card. Medicare was sending out a corrected card within a month! This way the patient will no longer have the frustrating situation of medical bills with an incorrect last name.<br />“The patient was extremely pleased with both of these clinicians’ extra efforts in assisting him. He stated “Susanne gave me the best gift ever, that timer! I love it and it helps me to not burn my bacon!”<br />    <br />                <br />                    <br />        <br />    <br />                <br />    <br />                <br />              <a><br />                <img src='/css/images/x-close-navy.svg' alt='close-icon' /><br />            </a><br />"

Due to COVID-19, they were unable to hold their normal fundraisers to raise money for the gas cards. This foundation began after Pat Dyer passed away from cancer and her husband, Bud, formed the memorial fund to provide some financial relief to patients after recognizing that cancer patients couldn’t make it to chemotherapy treatments due to the financial distress of driving.<br />Heartland Home Health and Hospice has the honor of caring for cancer patients throughout all stages of their journeys and wanted to show this foundation appreciation on their compassionate impact. <br />To watch the video, <a href='https://www.wane.com/news/local-news/heartland-home-care-hospice-donates-to-pat-dyer-memorial-fund/' target='_blank'>click here</a>.<br />                <br />                    <br />        <br />    <br />                <br />    <br />                  <a><br />                    <img src='/css/images/x-close-navy.svg' alt='close-icon' /><br />                </a><br />"

Together, they have earned this recognition as one of the top home care agencies in the country.”<br />Shannon Bailey, RN, Administrator, Heartland Home Health Care, credits efficient and effective processes and the longevity of staff with the agency’s ability to achieve recognition as one of the HomeCare Elite. 'We continue to find that timely intervention with the patient, family support and great communication are huge contributors to our continued improvement,' said Shannon.<br />“Congratulations to those leading agencies that earned a spot on HomeCare Elite,” said Marci Heydt, senior content manager for DecisionHealth. “Heartland Home Health Care and its peers have worked hard to improve quality outcomes while maintaining solid profit margins, which is increasingly difficult as home health agencies faced increased regulatory burdens each year.”<br />HomeCare Elite agencies are determined by an analysis of performance measures in quality outcomes, best practices implementation, patient experience (HHCAHPS), quality improvement and consistency, and financial health. In order to be considered, an agency must be Medicare-certified and have data for at least three outcomes in Home Health Compare.

All over Wisconsin people are buying fabric, sewing and donating masks for health care workers, skilled nursing and assisted living facilities, hospitals and the military.<br />According to Melissa Shea, Heartland Hospice Bereavement Coordinator, this is a well-organized endeavor which includes mask drop off and delivery. “It’s quite an amazing group, which is being led by my friend Liz. She started the group and has been expediting since March,” said Melissa.<br />Local volunteer, Jeni Klein, made and donated 50 cloth masks for the Heartland team. “I started making masks because I have seen first-hand how devastating viral infections like COVID-19 can be to the individuals they infect,” said Jeni. “I am honored to be able to help our community stay healthy. If even one life can be saved from my masks, it is worth it.”<br />“We will be wearing the masks while in the office and while with patients and their families to maintain infection control,” said Melissa. “I feel honored to have been provided masks and it is so refreshing to know that there are others willing to donate their time to keeping our staff and patients safe,” she said.<br />                <br />                    <br />        <br />    <br />    <br />        <br />        <br />            <br />                <br />                            <br />    <br />    <img src='/media/9441/20200528_080952.jpg' /><br />                <br />                        <br />                <br />                            <br />    <br />    <img src='/media/9442/20200528_120348.jpg' /><br />                <br />                    <br />        <br />    <br />                <br />    <br />                  <a><br />                    <img src='/css/images/x-close-navy.svg' alt='close-icon' /><br />                </a><br />"

Read below to see how their compassionate care helped this patient to get back on her feet.<br />Following her total knee replacement surgery, the patient stayed in a skilled nursing facility for three nights. The facility offered her an additional stay for one more day to help with her recovery but she declined. Prior to her discharge that Friday, she cancelled her home health services because she didn’t think she needed them.<br />After being home for a weekend, the director of the surgery center placed a courtesy call to the patient to check on her recovery. The director discovered that the patient was sitting in her tub on her shower chair crying. She explained that it was very difficult to get into the tub and that she didn’t have the energy or stamina to do so. Her husband was at home with her but he felt overwhelmed and wanted additional support. At this point, the patient was requesting to be placed back at the skilled nursing facility because she felt there were no other options for the level of care needed. She asked about her home layout which prompted the director to make a referral for the patient for occupational therapy.<br />Upon referral, Heartland Home Health immediately started services for the patient by sending a registered nurse to assess her condition. She agreed to start physical therapy the next day. The patient now had daily support between the nurse, physical therapist and occupational therapist. After one week, the patient started to show significant signs of improvement. She was able to move around easier and cope much better. She wasn’t quite ready to attempt a shower so the occupational therapist backed her shower chair up to the tub so she could sit and get her hair washed.<br />The patient was discharged from home health services with a plan to begin outpatient rehab services the following week. She was very thankful for the tremendous support from Heartland that helped her gain the confidence to move around. She admitted that once home, she was overwhelmed and in a great deal of pain. She reached the point of wanting to give up. With the additional support from Heartland Home Health Care, she was able to move around, bend her knee and get dressed. She was even smiling again!<br />                <br />                    <br />        <br />    <br />                <br />    <br />                  <a><br />                    <img src='/css/images/x-close-navy.svg' alt='close-icon' /><br />                </a><br />"

After a long hospital stay, Mr. E was discharged from a long-term rehab facility and referred to Heartland Home Health Care Serving Northeast Ohio.<br />    <br />                <br />                    <br />        <br />    <br />    <br />        <br />        <br />            <br />                <br />                            <br />    <br />His physical therapist, Dale, was determined to get Mr. E out of his power chair and walking before the first hint of spring in Cleveland. Mr. E’s own goal was to be able to leave his home and eat at a restaurant under his own power. Dale made Mr. E’s goal his own goal, and together the two began an incredible journey.<br />The first step was to get Mr. E out of his chair and walking independently with a walker. Dale soon realized that underneath all that determination, Mr. E was terrified of falling. So Dale worked with Mr. E on controlled falls in a safe environment and the steps to take to get back up. Once Mr. E felt more in control, they worked on strength training and balance activities, and tackled obstacles such as navigating his home, climbing steps and getting in and out of bed. Each new success was another victory and, eventually, Dale was able to transition Mr. E to a walker.<br />Heidi, Mr. E’s occupational therapist, helps patients regain their ability to do small, but important tasks to be more independent in their daily lives. At the start, Mr. E was completely dependent on others for food preparation, dressing and basic hygiene responsibilities. But with Heidi’s help, he is now able to make his own lunch, dress himself and manage his own hygiene.<br />Dale and Heidi worked with Mr. E every week until April. To celebrate all of his accomplishments, the Heartland team took Mr. E to his favorite pizzeria. He was able to exit his home, safely get into a car and walk into the pizzeria on his own using his walker, accomplishing the goals he and his therapists had strived for.<br />                <br />                    <br />        <br />    <br />                <br />    <br />                <br />              <a><br />                <img src='/css/images/x-close-navy.svg' alt='close-icon' /><br />            </a><br />"

He is very motivated to take care of himself and cooks multiple times per day. Susanne, Occupational Therapist, noticed that when he cooks items, he would often burn them due to forgetfulness. She also was concerned he would leave something on the stove and possibly start a fire.<br />“Susanne could have simply recommended he purchase a timer, but she actually went and purchased an inexpensive timer for him, to help him avoid burning his food and to reduce the risk of any type of a fire. She also used duct tape to tape down cords that were stretched across his pathways, which were tripping hazards for him. She also assisted with his medication management, making it easier and simpler for him to correctly take the medication at the right times.<br />“Jeff, our Physical Therapist, observed the same patient venting frustration at his medical bills, which didn’t include an “S” at the end of his last name.  He said this has been an ongoing problem since he turned age 65: 25 years ago. Jeff asked to look at his Medicare card and noticed that the Medicare card was spelled incorrectly, yet his Social Security card had the correct spelling. Jeff then called both Medicare and Social Security offices and coordinated with them to change the patient’s name to be spelled correctly on his Medicare card. Medicare was sending out a corrected card within a month! This way the patient will no longer have the frustrating situation of medical bills with an incorrect last name.<br />“The patient was extremely pleased with both of these clinicians’ extra efforts in assisting him. He stated “Susanne gave me the best gift ever, that timer! I love it and it helps me to not burn my bacon!”<br />    <br />                <br />                    <br />        <br />    <br />                <br />    <br />                <br />              <a><br />                <img src='/css/images/x-close-navy.svg' alt='close-icon' /><br />            </a><br />"

After a long hospital stay, Mr. E was discharged from a long-term rehab facility and referred to Heartland Home Health Care Serving Northeast Ohio.<br />    <br />                <br />                    <br />        <br />    <br />    <br />        <br />        <br />            <br />                <br />                            <br />    <br />His physical therapist, Dale, was determined to get Mr. E out of his power chair and walking before the first hint of spring in Cleveland. Mr. E’s own goal was to be able to leave his home and eat at a restaurant under his own power. Dale made Mr. E’s goal his own goal, and together the two began an incredible journey.<br />The first step was to get Mr. E out of his chair and walking independently with a walker. Dale soon realized that underneath all that determination, Mr. E was terrified of falling. So Dale worked with Mr. E on controlled falls in a safe environment and the steps to take to get back up. Once Mr. E felt more in control, they worked on strength training and balance activities, and tackled obstacles such as navigating his home, climbing steps and getting in and out of bed. Each new success was another victory and, eventually, Dale was able to transition Mr. E to a walker.<br />Heidi, Mr. E’s occupational therapist, helps patients regain their ability to do small, but important tasks to be more independent in their daily lives. At the start, Mr. E was completely dependent on others for food preparation, dressing and basic hygiene responsibilities. But with Heidi’s help, he is now able to make his own lunch, dress himself and manage his own hygiene.<br />Dale and Heidi worked with Mr. E every week until April. To celebrate all of his accomplishments, the Heartland team took Mr. E to his favorite pizzeria. He was able to exit his home, safely get into a car and walk into the pizzeria on his own using his walker, accomplishing the goals he and his therapists had strived for.<br />                <br />                    <br />        <br />    <br />                <br />    <br />                  <a><br />                    <img src='/css/images/x-close-navy.svg' alt='close-icon' /><br />                </a><br />"

After a long hospital stay, Mr. E was discharged from a long-term rehab facility and referred to Heartland Home Health Care Serving Northeast Ohio.<br />    <br />                <br />                    <br />        <br />    <br />    <br />        <br />        <br />            <br />                <br />                            <br />    <br />His physical therapist, Dale, was determined to get Mr. E out of his power chair and walking before the first hint of spring in Cleveland. Mr. E’s own goal was to be able to leave his home and eat at a restaurant under his own power. Dale made Mr. E’s goal his own goal, and together the two began an incredible journey.<br />The first step was to get Mr. E out of his chair and walking independently with a walker. Dale soon realized that underneath all that determination, Mr. E was terrified of falling. So Dale worked with Mr. E on controlled falls in a safe environment and the steps to take to get back up. Once Mr. E felt more in control, they worked on strength training and balance activities, and tackled obstacles such as navigating his home, climbing steps and getting in and out of bed. Each new success was another victory and, eventually, Dale was able to transition Mr. E to a walker.<br />Heidi, Mr. E’s occupational therapist, helps patients regain their ability to do small, but important tasks to be more independent in their daily lives. At the start, Mr. E was completely dependent on others for food preparation, dressing and basic hygiene responsibilities. But with Heidi’s help, he is now able to make his own lunch, dress himself and manage his own hygiene.<br />Dale and Heidi worked with Mr. E every week until April. To celebrate all of his accomplishments, the Heartland team took Mr. E to his favorite pizzeria. He was able to exit his home, safely get into a car and walk into the pizzeria on his own using his walker, accomplishing the goals he and his therapists had strived for.<br />                <br />                    <br />        <br />    <br />                <br />    <br />                <br />              <a><br />                <img src='/css/images/x-close-navy.svg' alt='close-icon' /><br />            </a><br />"

He is very motivated to take care of himself and cooks multiple times per day. Susanne, Occupational Therapist, noticed that when he cooks items, he would often burn them due to forgetfulness. She also was concerned he would leave something on the stove and possibly start a fire.<br />“Susanne could have simply recommended he purchase a timer, but she actually went and purchased an inexpensive timer for him, to help him avoid burning his food and to reduce the risk of any type of a fire. She also used duct tape to tape down cords that were stretched across his pathways, which were tripping hazards for him. She also assisted with his medication management, making it easier and simpler for him to correctly take the medication at the right times.<br />“Jeff, our Physical Therapist, observed the same patient venting frustration at his medical bills, which didn’t include an “S” at the end of his last name.  He said this has been an ongoing problem since he turned age 65: 25 years ago. Jeff asked to look at his Medicare card and noticed that the Medicare card was spelled incorrectly, yet his Social Security card had the correct spelling. Jeff then called both Medicare and Social Security offices and coordinated with them to change the patient’s name to be spelled correctly on his Medicare card. Medicare was sending out a corrected card within a month! This way the patient will no longer have the frustrating situation of medical bills with an incorrect last name.<br />“The patient was extremely pleased with both of these clinicians’ extra efforts in assisting him. He stated “Susanne gave me the best gift ever, that timer! I love it and it helps me to not burn my bacon!”<br />    <br />                <br />                    <br />        <br />    <br />                <br />    <br />                <br />              <a><br />                <img src='/css/images/x-close-navy.svg' alt='close-icon' /><br />            </a><br />"

After a long hospital stay, Mr. E was discharged from a long-term rehab facility and referred to Heartland Home Health Care Serving Northeast Ohio.<br />    <br />                <br />                    <br />        <br />    <br />    <br />        <br />        <br />            <br />                <br />                            <br />    <br />His physical therapist, Dale, was determined to get Mr. E out of his power chair and walking before the first hint of spring in Cleveland. Mr. E’s own goal was to be able to leave his home and eat at a restaurant under his own power. Dale made Mr. E’s goal his own goal, and together the two began an incredible journey.<br />The first step was to get Mr. E out of his chair and walking independently with a walker. Dale soon realized that underneath all that determination, Mr. E was terrified of falling. So Dale worked with Mr. E on controlled falls in a safe environment and the steps to take to get back up. Once Mr. E felt more in control, they worked on strength training and balance activities, and tackled obstacles such as navigating his home, climbing steps and getting in and out of bed. Each new success was another victory and, eventually, Dale was able to transition Mr. E to a walker.<br />Heidi, Mr. E’s occupational therapist, helps patients regain their ability to do small, but important tasks to be more independent in their daily lives. At the start, Mr. E was completely dependent on others for food preparation, dressing and basic hygiene responsibilities. But with Heidi’s help, he is now able to make his own lunch, dress himself and manage his own hygiene.<br />Dale and Heidi worked with Mr. E every week until April. To celebrate all of his accomplishments, the Heartland team took Mr. E to his favorite pizzeria. He was able to exit his home, safely get into a car and walk into the pizzeria on his own using his walker, accomplishing the goals he and his therapists had strived for.<br />                <br />                    <br />        <br />    <br />                <br />    <br />                  <a><br />                    <img src='/css/images/x-close-navy.svg' alt='close-icon' /><br />                </a><br />"

After a long hospital stay, Mr. E was discharged from a long-term rehab facility and referred to Heartland Home Health Care Serving Northeast Ohio.<br />    <br />                <br />                    <br />        <br />    <br />    <br />        <br />        <br />            <br />                <br />                            <br />    <br />His physical therapist, Dale, was determined to get Mr. E out of his power chair and walking before the first hint of spring in Cleveland. Mr. E’s own goal was to be able to leave his home and eat at a restaurant under his own power. Dale made Mr. E’s goal his own goal, and together the two began an incredible journey.<br />The first step was to get Mr. E out of his chair and walking independently with a walker. Dale soon realized that underneath all that determination, Mr. E was terrified of falling. So Dale worked with Mr. E on controlled falls in a safe environment and the steps to take to get back up. Once Mr. E felt more in control, they worked on strength training and balance activities, and tackled obstacles such as navigating his home, climbing steps and getting in and out of bed. Each new success was another victory and, eventually, Dale was able to transition Mr. E to a walker.<br />Heidi, Mr. E’s occupational therapist, helps patients regain their ability to do small, but important tasks to be more independent in their daily lives. At the start, Mr. E was completely dependent on others for food preparation, dressing and basic hygiene responsibilities. But with Heidi’s help, he is now able to make his own lunch, dress himself and manage his own hygiene.<br />Dale and Heidi worked with Mr. E every week until April. To celebrate all of his accomplishments, the Heartland team took Mr. E to his favorite pizzeria. He was able to exit his home, safely get into a car and walk into the pizzeria on his own using his walker, accomplishing the goals he and his therapists had strived for.<br />                <br />                    <br />        <br />    <br />                <br />    <br />                <br />              <a><br />                <img src='/css/images/x-close-navy.svg' alt='close-icon' /><br />            </a><br />"

He is very motivated to take care of himself and cooks multiple times per day. Susanne, Occupational Therapist, noticed that when he cooks items, he would often burn them due to forgetfulness. She also was concerned he would leave something on the stove and possibly start a fire.<br />“Susanne could have simply recommended he purchase a timer, but she actually went and purchased an inexpensive timer for him, to help him avoid burning his food and to reduce the risk of any type of a fire. She also used duct tape to tape down cords that were stretched across his pathways, which were tripping hazards for him. She also assisted with his medication management, making it easier and simpler for him to correctly take the medication at the right times.<br />“Jeff, our Physical Therapist, observed the same patient venting frustration at his medical bills, which didn’t include an “S” at the end of his last name.  He said this has been an ongoing problem since he turned age 65: 25 years ago. Jeff asked to look at his Medicare card and noticed that the Medicare card was spelled incorrectly, yet his Social Security card had the correct spelling. Jeff then called both Medicare and Social Security offices and coordinated with them to change the patient’s name to be spelled correctly on his Medicare card. Medicare was sending out a corrected card within a month! This way the patient will no longer have the frustrating situation of medical bills with an incorrect last name.<br />“The patient was extremely pleased with both of these clinicians’ extra efforts in assisting him. He stated “Susanne gave me the best gift ever, that timer! I love it and it helps me to not burn my bacon!”<br />    <br />                <br />                    <br />        <br />    <br />                <br />    <br />                <br />              <a><br />                <img src='/css/images/x-close-navy.svg' alt='close-icon' /><br />            </a><br />"

Tara said, “I send thank you cards to my staff each year to celebrate during Nurses Week. This year has had a different feeling for me. I’ve been in awe watching the bravery of the nurses throughout our country and my own team as they go out and face uncertainty of what they may encounter each day. We began referencing the ‘Nightingale Pledge’ and the meaning it has to all of us. That also caused me to reflect on my reasoning for becoming a nurse and how the experience of being a nurse has changed my life. I started writing the letter from my heart to show what being a nurse has meant to me and how much respect I have for each of them and what they do every day. The job is a difficult one, but so very worth it!” Read Tara’s letter below:<br />To each of my fellow nurses as we celebrate Nurses Week:  <br />This year is particularly special to me. At this very difficult time in our nation and across the world, I’m especially proud of our profession. I’ve been reflecting about becoming a nurse so many years ago; the excitement of earning my pin, then cap and finally graduating. At graduation, all of the nurses recited the “Nightingale Pledge” with our class. We promised before God to practice our profession faithfully for those committed to our care. <br />Could any of us have known then the impact of that very devotion to our lives? Many of us nurses feel “called” to the profession to help others and to make a positive impact in the world. What we don’t anticipate is the impact it will have on our own lives and that being a nurse will forever change us. It will build our memories, color our views, break our hearts, challenge us, grow us, lift us or flatten us.<br />At this difficult time in our nation and across the world, I’m so very proud of our profession and humbled to be part of it. As nurses stand, we’re an integral part of the health care team at the front line against this deadly pandemic, doing it with professionalism, selflessness, compassion and sacrifice. While not new to us, these qualities find themselves on full display exactly when our grateful nation needs to see them most. These are just the everyday qualities of a nurse.  Yes…we were “called”. Yes…we do make a difference. We didn’t/couldn’t have known what nursing held for us, but we did know, even then, what we had to give.<br />Thank you to all of you. In honor of National Nurses Week, please celebrate our profession with pride. Please celebrate knowing for sure that you really do make a difference in a profession that gets back as much as it gives.<br />Thank you!<br />Tara<br />                <br />                    <br />        <br />    <br />                <br />    <br />                  <a><br />                    <img src='/css/images/x-close-navy.svg' alt='close-icon' /><br />                </a><br />"

After a long hospital stay, Mr. E was discharged from a long-term rehab facility and referred to Heartland Home Health Care Serving Northeast Ohio.<br />    <br />                <br />                    <br />        <br />    <br />    <br />        <br />        <br />            <br />                <br />                            <br />    <br />His physical therapist, Dale, was determined to get Mr. E out of his power chair and walking before the first hint of spring in Cleveland. Mr. E’s own goal was to be able to leave his home and eat at a restaurant under his own power. Dale made Mr. E’s goal his own goal, and together the two began an incredible journey.<br />The first step was to get Mr. E out of his chair and walking independently with a walker. Dale soon realized that underneath all that determination, Mr. E was terrified of falling. So Dale worked with Mr. E on controlled falls in a safe environment and the steps to take to get back up. Once Mr. E felt more in control, they worked on strength training and balance activities, and tackled obstacles such as navigating his home, climbing steps and getting in and out of bed. Each new success was another victory and, eventually, Dale was able to transition Mr. E to a walker.<br />Heidi, Mr. E’s occupational therapist, helps patients regain their ability to do small, but important tasks to be more independent in their daily lives. At the start, Mr. E was completely dependent on others for food preparation, dressing and basic hygiene responsibilities. But with Heidi’s help, he is now able to make his own lunch, dress himself and manage his own hygiene.<br />Dale and Heidi worked with Mr. E every week until April. To celebrate all of his accomplishments, the Heartland team took Mr. E to his favorite pizzeria. He was able to exit his home, safely get into a car and walk into the pizzeria on his own using his walker, accomplishing the goals he and his therapists had strived for.<br />                <br />                    <br />        <br />    <br />                <br />    <br />                <br />              <a><br />                <img src='/css/images/x-close-navy.svg' alt='close-icon' /><br />            </a><br />"

He is very motivated to take care of himself and cooks multiple times per day. Susanne, Occupational Therapist, noticed that when he cooks items, he would often burn them due to forgetfulness. She also was concerned he would leave something on the stove and possibly start a fire.<br />“Susanne could have simply recommended he purchase a timer, but she actually went and purchased an inexpensive timer for him, to help him avoid burning his food and to reduce the risk of any type of a fire. She also used duct tape to tape down cords that were stretched across his pathways, which were tripping hazards for him. She also assisted with his medication management, making it easier and simpler for him to correctly take the medication at the right times.<br />“Jeff, our Physical Therapist, observed the same patient venting frustration at his medical bills, which didn’t include an “S” at the end of his last name.  He said this has been an ongoing problem since he turned age 65: 25 years ago. Jeff asked to look at his Medicare card and noticed that the Medicare card was spelled incorrectly, yet his Social Security card had the correct spelling. Jeff then called both Medicare and Social Security offices and coordinated with them to change the patient’s name to be spelled correctly on his Medicare card. Medicare was sending out a corrected card within a month! This way the patient will no longer have the frustrating situation of medical bills with an incorrect last name.<br />“The patient was extremely pleased with both of these clinicians’ extra efforts in assisting him. He stated “Susanne gave me the best gift ever, that timer! I love it and it helps me to not burn my bacon!”<br />    <br />                <br />                    <br />        <br />    <br />                <br />    <br />                <br />              <a><br />                <img src='/css/images/x-close-navy.svg' alt='close-icon' /><br />            </a><br />"

The reason I chose your company is the physical therapist, Christine, was highly recommended to me. After some research, I found she worked for your company. I have had eight physical therapists in my life before.<br />    <br />                            <br />    <br />    <br />        She explained what exercises we did and why, and she pushed me when I needed pushed, but never past my limit. I have not had someone this good before. I am so glad she was recommended. The nurse you sent, Kristin, was very professional and polite. She knew her job and did it very well. We liked her and felt very comfortable with her as well. Zack came out twice; very professional, polite, knew his job and did it very well.<br />    <br />                            <br />    <br />    <br />        Your company is VERY lucky to have outstanding, dedicated employees like these three!!! I feel if all your employees are half this good, you have an outstanding company, one I will recommend to other people. Thank you for the great job they did for me.<br />    <br />                <br />                    <br />        <br />    <br />                <br />    <br />                  <a><br />                    <img src='/css/images/x-close-navy.svg' alt='close-icon' /><br />                </a><br />"

My name is Lisa, and I was just calling to let you know that my mother-in-law is being cared for by Heartland Home Health Care out of Shawnee, Oklahoma. They are doing an extraordinarily wonderful job with her. They have accomplished a complete 180: she is getting her strength back and doing great. They’re providing home health care, PT and OT for her, and I just wanted to thank you guys, and I really want you to pass that along to the folks who are working with her.<br />    <br />                            <br />    <br />    <br />        Jennifer is one of her therapists, and she and another whose name I don’t know are doing an outstanding job. I just wanted to let you know that. I am so appreciative, and if we can be of any help, if you guys need anything from us, my husband and I are available any time.<br />    <br />                <br />                    <br />        <br />    <br />                <br />    <br />                  <a><br />                    <img src='/css/images/x-close-navy.svg' alt='close-icon' /><br />                </a><br />"

After a long hospital stay, Mr. E was discharged from a long-term rehab facility and referred to Heartland Home Health Care Serving Northeast Ohio.<br />    <br />                <br />                    <br />        <br />    <br />    <br />        <br />        <br />            <br />                <br />                            <br />    <br />His physical therapist, Dale, was determined to get Mr. E out of his power chair and walking before the first hint of spring in Cleveland. Mr. E’s own goal was to be able to leave his home and eat at a restaurant under his own power. Dale made Mr. E’s goal his own goal, and together the two began an incredible journey.<br />The first step was to get Mr. E out of his chair and walking independently with a walker. Dale soon realized that underneath all that determination, Mr. E was terrified of falling. So Dale worked with Mr. E on controlled falls in a safe environment and the steps to take to get back up. Once Mr. E felt more in control, they worked on strength training and balance activities, and tackled obstacles such as navigating his home, climbing steps and getting in and out of bed. Each new success was another victory and, eventually, Dale was able to transition Mr. E to a walker.<br />Heidi, Mr. E’s occupational therapist, helps patients regain their ability to do small, but important tasks to be more independent in their daily lives. At the start, Mr. E was completely dependent on others for food preparation, dressing and basic hygiene responsibilities. But with Heidi’s help, he is now able to make his own lunch, dress himself and manage his own hygiene.<br />Dale and Heidi worked with Mr. E every week until April. To celebrate all of his accomplishments, the Heartland team took Mr. E to his favorite pizzeria. He was able to exit his home, safely get into a car and walk into the pizzeria on his own using his walker, accomplishing the goals he and his therapists had strived for.<br />                <br />                    <br />        <br />    <br />                <br />    <br />                <br />              <a><br />                <img src='/css/images/x-close-navy.svg' alt='close-icon' /><br />            </a><br />"

He is very motivated to take care of himself and cooks multiple times per day. Susanne, Occupational Therapist, noticed that when he cooks items, he would often burn them due to forgetfulness. She also was concerned he would leave something on the stove and possibly start a fire.<br />“Susanne could have simply recommended he purchase a timer, but she actually went and purchased an inexpensive timer for him, to help him avoid burning his food and to reduce the risk of any type of a fire. She also used duct tape to tape down cords that were stretched across his pathways, which were tripping hazards for him. She also assisted with his medication management, making it easier and simpler for him to correctly take the medication at the right times.<br />“Jeff, our Physical Therapist, observed the same patient venting frustration at his medical bills, which didn’t include an “S” at the end of his last name.  He said this has been an ongoing problem since he turned age 65: 25 years ago. Jeff asked to look at his Medicare card and noticed that the Medicare card was spelled incorrectly, yet his Social Security card had the correct spelling. Jeff then called both Medicare and Social Security offices and coordinated with them to change the patient’s name to be spelled correctly on his Medicare card. Medicare was sending out a corrected card within a month! This way the patient will no longer have the frustrating situation of medical bills with an incorrect last name.<br />“The patient was extremely pleased with both of these clinicians’ extra efforts in assisting him. He stated “Susanne gave me the best gift ever, that timer! I love it and it helps me to not burn my bacon!”<br />    <br />                <br />                    <br />        <br />    <br />                <br />    <br />                <br />              <a><br />                <img src='/css/images/x-close-navy.svg' alt='close-icon' /><br />            </a><br />"

Elizabeth, my Heartland nurse, was becoming concerned about my weight as it approached 257 lbs. One day she looked at me and gently explained, ‘Cliff, I understand that you just lost your wife and how difficult that is for you, please remember that you still have your children, grandchildren and great grandchildren who all worship you. I am concerned about your weight. Now we are going to do something about it.’ From that day on, Elizabeth had me keep a daily journal to record everything that I ate, the calories I consumed and any physical activities I’ve done. I write notes and poems in this journal and the Heartland nurses that visit write back giving me suggestions or praises for what I am doing.”<br />“These nurses have always taken good care of me. In fact they have saved my life, several times. Heartland Home Health care is the only company that I want to take care of me!” One day when Clifford’s blood sugar was low when she arrived, Elizabeth had him eat and checked that his blood sugar returned to normal. As a follow-up later that day, she texted and called Clifford. When he didn’t respond, she returned to the home to find him unconscious, and called EMS. “The doctors said another hour and I would have been gone. These nurses never stop taking care of you 24/7!”<br /> <br />Clifford Conway<br />Heartland Home Health Care Patient, 2016<br />Vietnam Veteran, Father of 5, Grandfather of 23,<br />Great grandfather of 24, Great-great grandfather of 5<br />                <br />                    <br />        <br />    <br />                <br />    <br />                  <a><br />                    <img src='/css/images/x-close-navy.svg' alt='close-icon' /><br />                </a><br />"

After a long hospital stay, Mr. E was discharged from a long-term rehab facility and referred to Heartland Home Health Care Serving Northeast Ohio.<br />    <br />                <br />                    <br />        <br />    <br />    <br />        <br />        <br />            <br />                <br />                            <br />    <br />His physical therapist, Dale, was determined to get Mr. E out of his power chair and walking before the first hint of spring in Cleveland. Mr. E’s own goal was to be able to leave his home and eat at a restaurant under his own power. Dale made Mr. E’s goal his own goal, and together the two began an incredible journey.<br />The first step was to get Mr. E out of his chair and walking independently with a walker. Dale soon realized that underneath all that determination, Mr. E was terrified of falling. So Dale worked with Mr. E on controlled falls in a safe environment and the steps to take to get back up. Once Mr. E felt more in control, they worked on strength training and balance activities, and tackled obstacles such as navigating his home, climbing steps and getting in and out of bed. Each new success was another victory and, eventually, Dale was able to transition Mr. E to a walker.<br />Heidi, Mr. E’s occupational therapist, helps patients regain their ability to do small, but important tasks to be more independent in their daily lives. At the start, Mr. E was completely dependent on others for food preparation, dressing and basic hygiene responsibilities. But with Heidi’s help, he is now able to make his own lunch, dress himself and manage his own hygiene.<br />Dale and Heidi worked with Mr. E every week until April. To celebrate all of his accomplishments, the Heartland team took Mr. E to his favorite pizzeria. He was able to exit his home, safely get into a car and walk into the pizzeria on his own using his walker, accomplishing the goals he and his therapists had strived for.<br />                <br />                    <br />        <br />    <br />                <br />    <br />                <br />              <a><br />                <img src='/css/images/x-close-navy.svg' alt='close-icon' /><br />            </a><br />"

He is very motivated to take care of himself and cooks multiple times per day. Susanne, Occupational Therapist, noticed that when he cooks items, he would often burn them due to forgetfulness. She also was concerned he would leave something on the stove and possibly start a fire.<br />“Susanne could have simply recommended he purchase a timer, but she actually went and purchased an inexpensive timer for him, to help him avoid burning his food and to reduce the risk of any type of a fire. She also used duct tape to tape down cords that were stretched across his pathways, which were tripping hazards for him. She also assisted with his medication management, making it easier and simpler for him to correctly take the medication at the right times.<br />“Jeff, our Physical Therapist, observed the same patient venting frustration at his medical bills, which didn’t include an “S” at the end of his last name.  He said this has been an ongoing problem since he turned age 65: 25 years ago. Jeff asked to look at his Medicare card and noticed that the Medicare card was spelled incorrectly, yet his Social Security card had the correct spelling. Jeff then called both Medicare and Social Security offices and coordinated with them to change the patient’s name to be spelled correctly on his Medicare card. Medicare was sending out a corrected card within a month! This way the patient will no longer have the frustrating situation of medical bills with an incorrect last name.<br />“The patient was extremely pleased with both of these clinicians’ extra efforts in assisting him. He stated “Susanne gave me the best gift ever, that timer! I love it and it helps me to not burn my bacon!”<br />    <br />                <br />                    <br />        <br />    <br />                <br />    <br />                <br />              <a><br />                <img src='/css/images/x-close-navy.svg' alt='close-icon' /><br />            </a><br />"

After a long hospital stay, Mr. E was discharged from a long-term rehab facility and referred to Heartland Home Health Care Serving Northeast Ohio.<br />    <br />                <br />                    <br />        <br />    <br />    <br />        <br />        <br />            <br />                <br />                            <br />    <br />His physical therapist, Dale, was determined to get Mr. E out of his power chair and walking before the first hint of spring in Cleveland. Mr. E’s own goal was to be able to leave his home and eat at a restaurant under his own power. Dale made Mr. E’s goal his own goal, and together the two began an incredible journey.<br />The first step was to get Mr. E out of his chair and walking independently with a walker. Dale soon realized that underneath all that determination, Mr. E was terrified of falling. So Dale worked with Mr. E on controlled falls in a safe environment and the steps to take to get back up. Once Mr. E felt more in control, they worked on strength training and balance activities, and tackled obstacles such as navigating his home, climbing steps and getting in and out of bed. Each new success was another victory and, eventually, Dale was able to transition Mr. E to a walker.<br />Heidi, Mr. E’s occupational therapist, helps patients regain their ability to do small, but important tasks to be more independent in their daily lives. At the start, Mr. E was completely dependent on others for food preparation, dressing and basic hygiene responsibilities. But with Heidi’s help, he is now able to make his own lunch, dress himself and manage his own hygiene.<br />Dale and Heidi worked with Mr. E every week until April. To celebrate all of his accomplishments, the Heartland team took Mr. E to his favorite pizzeria. He was able to exit his home, safely get into a car and walk into the pizzeria on his own using his walker, accomplishing the goals he and his therapists had strived for.<br />                <br />                    <br />        <br />    <br />                <br />    <br />                <br />              <a><br />                <img src='/css/images/x-close-navy.svg' alt='close-icon' /><br />            </a><br />"

He is very motivated to take care of himself and cooks multiple times per day. Susanne, Occupational Therapist, noticed that when he cooks items, he would often burn them due to forgetfulness. She also was concerned he would leave something on the stove and possibly start a fire.<br />“Susanne could have simply recommended he purchase a timer, but she actually went and purchased an inexpensive timer for him, to help him avoid burning his food and to reduce the risk of any type of a fire. She also used duct tape to tape down cords that were stretched across his pathways, which were tripping hazards for him. She also assisted with his medication management, making it easier and simpler for him to correctly take the medication at the right times.<br />“Jeff, our Physical Therapist, observed the same patient venting frustration at his medical bills, which didn’t include an “S” at the end of his last name.  He said this has been an ongoing problem since he turned age 65: 25 years ago. Jeff asked to look at his Medicare card and noticed that the Medicare card was spelled incorrectly, yet his Social Security card had the correct spelling. Jeff then called both Medicare and Social Security offices and coordinated with them to change the patient’s name to be spelled correctly on his Medicare card. Medicare was sending out a corrected card within a month! This way the patient will no longer have the frustrating situation of medical bills with an incorrect last name.<br />“The patient was extremely pleased with both of these clinicians’ extra efforts in assisting him. He stated “Susanne gave me the best gift ever, that timer! I love it and it helps me to not burn my bacon!”<br />    <br />                <br />                    <br />        <br />    <br />                <br />    <br />                <br />              <a><br />                <img src='/css/images/x-close-navy.svg' alt='close-icon' /><br />            </a><br />"

Andrea Tocco, RN, Case Manager with ProMedica Home Health, officially discharged Mike as a COVID-19 patient.<br />“I’m so proud of you,” Andrea said. “You made it. I told you we will get through this together. This was both of our first times doing this.”<br />On April 5, Mike tested positive for the novel coronavirus and assumed the diagnosis would be his death sentence. After a month of being in the hospital and then at home, it was a surreal moment for Mike to hear that he had recovered. When Mike returned home to self-quarantine, Andrea visited with him weekly to check his vitals.<br />“A big weight has been lifted,” Mike said. “I don’t ever want to go through something like that again.”<br />To read more about Mike's story, <a href='https://www.monroenews.com/news/20200503/covid-19-survivor-wonders-why-am-i-still-here' target='_blank'>click here</a>.<br />                <br />                    <br />        <br />    <br />                <br />    <br />                  <a><br />                    <img src='/css/images/x-close-navy.svg' alt='close-icon' /><br />                </a><br />"

However, through all the fear and uncertainty, frontline workers put on a brave face and continue to support and care for patients, residents and other community members. But even behind a brave face, many frontline workers are still scared.<br />Marie DeLine, Registered Nurse with ProMedica Home Health Serving Monroe and Lenawee Counties, recently shared her experiences over the last couple of weeks, from how caring for patients who have tested positive has made her feel, to how helpful other team members have been during this difficult time:<br />“I was asked to start seeing positive patients about two weeks ago. I was nervous, very nervous. Mary Holtzen, Staff Educator, asked me to come in and worked with me on donning and doffing my PPE until I was comfortable. She even wrote me a card with step-by-step instructions in case I got scared and forgot. She put her number on the bottom and told me to call her if I needed anything.”<br />“Someone from the telehealth team met me at my first patient’s home and the gentleman walked me through installing the equipment. It went well and my patient couldn't believe the level of care he was going to receive AFTER leaving the hospital. He was scared, but said it made him feel safe knowing he could call us at any time, and someone was going to be checking on him daily.”<br />“After my first patient, Sara Brown, Manager of Operations, and Brook Broughton, Director of Professional Services, both called me on my way home to see how I was doing. They knew that I was nervous to be seeing positive patients and asked if I needed anything.”<br />“Today I had three positive patients on my schedule and only had enough PPE for two visits. I called my educator, Mary. She immediately stopped what she was doing to drive all the way from Dundee to downtown Monroe to deliver more PPE to me.”<br />“I was scared in the beginning, but to be honest, I'm still scared. Seeing patients with a terrible illness that is killing hundreds in my state is not easy. It is constantly on my mind. Am I doing everything to protect myself, my other patients and my own family?”<br />“Whether I am scared or not, our patients need a nurse when they come home. They have many questions and are very fragile. Many are on oxygen, afraid and don’t know what to do now that they are home. I am glad to be there for support, to be the one to give them confidence and to give them an ear to listen after being so alone in the hospital. My patient cried today because he was so happy that I listened to his story during my visit. He was intubated and alone for weeks and he said he was sure he would never see his family again.”<br />“I'm scared but my team gives me the emotional support I need to be the best nurse I can be. Checking on me and getting me my equipment as soon as possible… I have all the PPE and support I need to feel safe and do my job. I am VERY THANKFUL.”<br />“From the bottom of my heart, THANK YOU ALL for being there for me during this difficult time. Mary Holtson, Brook Broughton, Sara Brown, telehealth and all my Monroe team.”<br />                <br />                    <br />        <br />    <br />                <br />    <br />                  <a><br />                    <img src='/css/images/x-close-navy.svg' alt='close-icon' /><br />                </a><br />"

After a long hospital stay, Mr. E was discharged from a long-term rehab facility and referred to Heartland Home Health Care Serving Northeast Ohio.<br />    <br />                <br />                    <br />        <br />    <br />    <br />        <br />        <br />            <br />                <br />                            <br />    <br />His physical therapist, Dale, was determined to get Mr. E out of his power chair and walking before the first hint of spring in Cleveland. Mr. E’s own goal was to be able to leave his home and eat at a restaurant under his own power. Dale made Mr. E’s goal his own goal, and together the two began an incredible journey.<br />The first step was to get Mr. E out of his chair and walking independently with a walker. Dale soon realized that underneath all that determination, Mr. E was terrified of falling. So Dale worked with Mr. E on controlled falls in a safe environment and the steps to take to get back up. Once Mr. E felt more in control, they worked on strength training and balance activities, and tackled obstacles such as navigating his home, climbing steps and getting in and out of bed. Each new success was another victory and, eventually, Dale was able to transition Mr. E to a walker.<br />Heidi, Mr. E’s occupational therapist, helps patients regain their ability to do small, but important tasks to be more independent in their daily lives. At the start, Mr. E was completely dependent on others for food preparation, dressing and basic hygiene responsibilities.

He is very motivated to take care of himself and cooks multiple times per day. Susanne, Occupational Therapist, noticed that when he cooks items, he would often burn them due to forgetfulness. She also was concerned he would leave something on the stove and possibly start a fire.<br />“Susanne could have simply recommended he purchase a timer, but she actually went and purchased an inexpensive timer for him, to help him avoid burning his food and to reduce the risk of any type of a fire. She also used duct tape to tape down cords that were stretched across his pathways, which were tripping hazards for him. She also assisted with his medication management, making it easier and simpler for him to correctly take the medication at the right times.<br />“Jeff, our Physical Therapist, observed the same patient venting frustration at his medical bills, which didn’t include an “S” at the end of his last name.  He said this has been an ongoing problem since he turned age 65: 25 years ago. Jeff asked to look at his Medicare card and noticed that the Medicare card was spelled incorrectly, yet his Social Security card had the correct spelling. Jeff then called both Medicare and Social Security offices and coordinated with them to change the patient’s name to be spelled correctly on his Medicare card. Medicare was sending out a corrected card within a month! This way the patient will no longer have the frustrating situation of medical bills with an incorrect last name.<br />“The patient was extremely pleased with both of these clinicians’ extra efforts in assisting him. He stated “Susanne gave me the best gift ever, that timer! I love it and it helps me to not burn my bacon!”<br />    <br />                <br />                    <br />        <br />    <br />                <br />    <br />                <br />              <a><br />                <img src='/css/images/x-close-navy.svg' alt='close-icon' /><br />            </a><br />"
