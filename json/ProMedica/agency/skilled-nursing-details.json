I was treated with kindness and respect by the entire team. They helped me with every need and looked after me while I was there for rehabilitation. The employees paid attention to small details and went the extra mile to make sure I could meet all of my goals. Because of this, when I had a pacemaker placed in 2022 and needed rehabilitation again, I chose to return and received the same great care. I can’t thank the employees enough for all their care and hard work to help me return home not once, but twice.”  - Victoria<br />                <br />                    <br />        <br />    <br />                <br />    <br />                  <a><br />                    <img src='/css/images/x-close-navy.svg' alt='close-icon' /><br />                </a><br />"

At first she thought her back pain would go away, but when she started having migraines, Brandi went to the emergency room and discovered she would need rehabilitative therapists before going home.<br />Post-Acute Need:<br /> Brandi was in need of physical and occupational therapy to help her get back to an active lifestyle quickly and safely after her hospitalization. She required a skilled nursing facility that could help treat her recent diagnosis of transverse myelitis, an inflammation of her spinal cord.<br />Post-Acute Stay:<br /> As a young woman, Brandi never dreamt she would be told she needed to admit to a skilled nursing facility for rehab. Once she arrived at Heartland at ProMedica, everyone - from the aides, nurses and other therapy staff - helped Brandi accomplish her goal of returning home safely to her husband and daughter.<br />Back to Active:<br />                            <br />    <br />    <br />        'I was terrified and completely out of my comfort zone, but I can't say enough about how amazing everyone is here.

They all worked cohesively with my cardiologist to make sure I was strong and healthy enough to go home safely. I felt so confident and well prepared to return back to my day-to-day routine!

The centers earned Best Nursing Homes status by achieving a rating of “High Performing,” the highest possible rating, for Short-Term Rehabilitation and Long-Term Care. U.S. News gives the designation of Best Nursing Home only to those homes that satisfy U.S. News’s assessment of the appropriate use of key services and consistent performance in quality measures.<br />“We are proud of our centers that were identified as one of the best skilled nursing centers in the country. Our employees are dedicated to helping our patients and residents’ transition successfully from hospital to home, a critical step in a successful recovery. These awards illustrate the core of our mission-based organization, which is to improve the health and well-being of our patients, residents and the community,” said Angela Brandt, President of ProMedica Senior Care.<br />Centers that earned Best Nursing Homes status for both Short-Term Rehabilitation and Long-Term Care:<br />ProMedica Skilled Nursing and Rehabilitation (formerly ManorCare Health Services – Boulder)<br />ProMedica Skilled Nursing and Rehabilitation (formerly ManorCare Health Services - Cedar Rapids)<br />ManorCare Health Services - Citrus Heights<br />ProMedica Skilled Nursing and Rehabilitation (formerly ManorCare Health Services - Fair Oaks)<br />ProMedica Skilled Nursing and Rehabilitation (formerly ManorCare Health Services – Potomac)<br />ProMedica Skilled Nursing and Rehabilitation (formerly ManorCare Health Services - Salmon Creek)<br />ManorCare Health Services – Sunnyvale<br />ManorCare Health Services - Tice Valley<br />ProMedica Skilled Nursing and Rehabilitation (Rossmoor) (formerly ManorCare Health Services - Walnut Creek)<br />ProMedica Skilled Nursing and Rehabilitation (formerly ManorCare Nursing and Rehabilitation Center – Kingsford)<br />ProMedica Skilled Nursing and Rehabilitation (formerly ManorCare of Arlington Heights)<br />ProMedica Skilled Nursing and Rehabilitation (formerly ManorCare of Palos Heights West)<br />ProMedica Skilled Nursing and Rehabilitation (North Hills)<br />ProMedica Total Rehab + (formerly ProMedica Skilled Nursing and Rehabilitation – Willow Grove)<br />Now in its 12th year, the U.S. News <a href='http://health.usnews.com/best-nursing-homes'>Best Nursing Homes</a> ratings and profiles offer comprehensive information about care, safety, health inspections, staffing and more for nearly all of the nation’s 15,000-plus nursing homes. The Best Nursing Homes ratings reflect U.S. News’ exclusive analysis of publicly available data using a methodology defined by U.S. News that evaluates factors that it has determined most greatly impact patient and resident care, safety, and outcomes. This year, to accompany the new ratings, nursing home profile pages were updated to include staff and resident COVID-19 vaccination rates.<br />“U.S. News takes pride in providing relevant, up-to-date information when making any sort of health care decision,” says Zach Adams, health data engineer at U.S. News. “Profiles now include resident and staff COVID-19 vaccination rates alongside information on how to pay for a facility. This important information can help families, residents and caregivers make a decision that keeps safety and accessibility at the highest priority.”<br />The Best Nursing Home finder features ratings on both long-term and short-term care. The Long-Term Care Rating aims to provide prospective residents who need help with daily activities, and their families, with analysis and information regarding the quality of care provided by nursing homes. The rating includes data on staffing, success in preventing ER visits and COVID-19 vaccination rates, among other metrics. The Short-Term Rating incorporates measures of quality including consistency of registered nurse staffing, use of antipsychotic drugs and success in preventing falls.<br />For more information behind both U.S. News ratings please refer to the <a href='https://health.usnews.com/health-news/best-nursing-homes/articles/faq-how-we-rate-nursing-homes'>FAQ</a>.<br />                <br />                    <br />        <br />    <br />                <br />    <br />                  <a><br />                    <img src='/css/images/x-close-navy.svg' alt='close-icon' /><br />                </a><br />"

I wasn’t able to walk on my foot after surgery. I was very weak, and in a wheelchair at all times. Now, I able to walk again thanks to all the staff at ManorCare, and I feel much stronger and I feel more independent. The physical therapy and occupational therapy teams have helped me improve my balance to walk again. I set a goal with the physical therapy team to walk up twenty-eight stairs, and I accomplished that goal. Also, I am able to walk four hundred and fifty feet. I could only walk twenty to thirty feet when I first arrived at ManorCare. I am very proud of my accomplishments and I would like to thank all the staff for helping me during this journey. Everyone at ManorCare has been so friendly and Cindy, my nurse, goes above and beyond for me. Christian, physical therapist, is always smiling and motivates me to accomplish my goals.'<br />'I am very happy I chose ManorCare, and I am very excited to feel independent again at home.' – Starlene, MedBridge at ManorCare Patient<br />    <br />                <br />                    <br />        <br />    <br />                <br />    <br />                  <a><br />                    <img src='/css/images/x-close-navy.svg' alt='close-icon' /><br />                </a><br />"

She started her career in the memory care unit as a CNA. When Sharon’s mother, father and sister were diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease, it became challenging to not only care for her family members but also the patients and residents at the center. She decided to work in housekeeping to still be there for the patients and residents, just in a different role.<br />Sharon has a personal connection to the Alzheimer’s Association, as her mother, father and sister all passed away with Alzheimer’s disease. This created a strong desire for her to do whatever she could to help the Alzheimer’s Association in its search for a cure. Sharon got involved with the Alzheimer’s Association 7 years ago after her father passed away. She has been a long-time participant in the Walk to End Alzheimer’s in the Lehigh Valley community.<br />Due to the pandemic last year, the Walk to End Alzheimer’s became a virtual event. Sharon participated in the virtual walk and honored her loved ones, patients and residents by walking laps around the center. She also saved all of her overtime to donate $5,806 to the Alzheimer’s Association Walk to End Alzheimer’s.<br />Sharon received two awards from the Alzheimer’s Association along with a letter from Lori Wehr, walk manager at Alzheimer’s Association. She received the 2020 Top Frontline Hero and the 2020 Top National Team. In the letter, Lori stated, <br />“Our Frontline Hero award was given to only one recipient in 2020 and was a special recognition that had never been awarded before. Your efforts to support the Walk while working on the front lines makes you truly a hero.”<br />                <br />                    <br />        <br />    <br />    <br />        <br />        <br />            <br />                <br />                            <br />    <br />    <img src='/media/10530/sharond2.jpeg' /><br />                <br />                        <br />                <br />                            <br />    <br />    <img src='/media/10532/sharondletter.jpeg' /><br />                <br />                        <br />                <br />                            <br />    <br />    <img src='/media/10531/sharond3.jpeg' /><br />                <br />                    <br />        <br />    <br />                <br />    <br />                  <a><br />                    <img src='/css/images/x-close-navy.svg' alt='close-icon' /><br />                </a><br />"

I discharged from the hospital to my cousin’s home. I needed to adjust to living in someone else’s home and often felt I had lost my independence and privacy. With a lot of encouragement from my family, I was able to move into my own apartment after living with my cousin for a year.<br />    <br />                            <br />    <br />    <br />        Unfortunately, while living on my own, I collapsed and was hospitalized. During my hospital stay Dr. Martin referred me to ManorCare Health Services - West Allen. Initially I questioned the need for skilled nursing care. I remember that I was very scared, and I prayed a lot. While receiving post-acute care at ManorCare - West Allen, I worked with the therapy team to improve my strength, coordination and balance.<br />    <br />                            <br />    <br />    <br />        Upon completion of my therapy I felt empowered to complete my self-care independently.  While I have family that want me to come live with them, I like my independence and privacy and respect theirs as well. For that reason, I chose to make ManorCare – West Allen my home about five years ago.  I look forward to someday returning to my own apartment but for now living at ManorCare gives me piece-of-mind. I anticipate the day the pandemic is over, and we can all enjoy the world again. But for now, I feel I’m in the safest place in the world.<br />    <br />                            <br />    <br />    <br />        I definitely recommend ManorCare - West Allen mainly because of the skilled nursing and therapy care.' - Carolyn, ManorCare Resident<br />    <br />                <br />                    <br />        <br />    <br />                <br />    <br />                  <a><br />                    <img src='/css/images/x-close-navy.svg' alt='close-icon' /><br />                </a><br />"

The distinction is the first of three progressive award levels through the AHCA/NCAL National Quality Award Program. The program, presented by the leading association in long term and post-acute care, honors association members across the country that have demonstrated their commitment to improving quality of care for seniors and people with disabilities.<br />The American Health Care Association and National Center for Assisted Living (AHCA/NCAL) represents more that 14,000 non-profit and proprietary skilled nursing centers, assisted living communities, sub-acute centers and homes for individuals with intellectual and development disabilities. By delivering solutions for quality care, AHCA/NCAL aims to improve the lives of the nearly 5 million seniors and individuals with disabilities who receive long term or post-acute care in our facilities each year.<br />We are happy to announce the following centers who have earned the 2021 Bronze – Commitment to Quality Award:<br />ManorCare Health Services – Wilmington (DE)<br />Heartland Health Care &amp; Rehabilitation Center – Sarasota (FL)<br />ManorCare Health Services At Lely Palms (FL)<br />ManorCare Health Services – Delray (FL)<br />ManorCare Health Services – Dubuque (IA)<br />ManorCare Health Services – Palos Heights West (IL)<br />Heartland Health Care Center – Briarwood (MI)<br />ManorCare Nursing &amp; Rehabilitation Center (Kingsford, MI)<br />ManorCare Health Services – West Deptford (NJ)<br />Heartland Health Care Center – Greenville West (SC)<br /> <br />Bronze – Commitment to Quality Award applicants are able to describe their mission, characteristics, and key challenges and to recognize the relationship of these factors to their ability to achieve performance improvement. The Bronze Award recognizes the provider for developing a foundation to begin a journey of continuous quality improvement, and does not necessarily correspond to any public measure of performance.<br />The AHCA/NCAL National Quality Award Program is a progressive, three-step process that encourages the continuous learning, development, and execution of integrated quality systems to achieve performance excellence. Each progressive step requires a more detailed and comprehensive demonstration of quality integration and performance. The criteria for each step is based on the Baldrige Performance Excellence Program.<br />Congratulations to our centers on their achievements to receive this award!<br /><a href='https://www.ahcancal.org/Quality/National-Quality-Award-Program/Pages/default.aspx'>https://www.ahcancal.org/Quality/National-Quality-Award-Program/Pages/default.aspx</a><br />                <br />                    <br />        <br />    <br />                <br />    <br />                  <a><br />                    <img src='/css/images/x-close-navy.svg' alt='close-icon' /><br />                </a><br />"

She began her journey of life with HCR ManorCare a few years ago as a resident of the independent living facility and subsequently moved to the ManorCare @ Lely Palms facility on March 6, 2014. Her entire stay in both facilities was marked by an exemplary level of care and kindness that should be the example of what other facilities follow and what families should expect from all elderly care facilities.<br />    <br />                            <br />    <br />    <br />        There are very many people that we would like to mention as having touched our Mother's life, and although we cannot name them all, we hold them in high regard and thank them also. We would like to call your attention to a few people who showed the type of attention and care that we are talking about. In no particular order they are Maribel, Mitch, Giovanni, Tara, Marie and Jeurgen. These are but a few of the wonderful people who touched Mom's life. Your administrators, doctors, nurses, CNAs, physical therapists, social directors and even the custodians are a credit to the challenge that is elderly care.<br />    <br />                            <br />    <br />    <br />        We are hopeful that Mom touched their lives, as much as they touched hers.<br />    <br />                <br />                    <br />        <br />    <br />                <br />    <br />                  <a><br />                    <img src='/css/images/x-close-navy.svg' alt='close-icon' /><br />                </a><br />"
