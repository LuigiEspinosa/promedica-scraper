There are visual cues everywhere. Symbols and colors help our residents avoid confusion, stay oriented and remain as independent as possible. Descriptive photos can often take the place of language and signs. These cues are designed not only to help residents effortlessly navigate the halls and pathways, but also to stimulate memory and create triggers.<br />        <br />",

They may prefer to stroll outdoors, prune plants, sweep the porch, sand wood or, for example, work on a word game. Individual Pursuits have been created with these individuals in mind. Many, including individuals diagnosed with atypical dementias, often benefit from individual pursuits versus large group programming.<br />        <br />",

Based on personal and historic information, ETT programs are developed to help residents socialize and share with others. Each ETT program is personalized based on cognitive and functional ability.

Everyday tasks such as making the bed, performing light housekeeping, setting the table and folding the laundry are all examples of life skills programming. Successful completion of familiar tasks can help residents feel productive and good about themselves.<br />        <br />",

The environment is carefully created with scents of lavender, soft music, nature scenes, hydration and nurturing for attention to the senses of smell, touch, taste, hearing and vision.<br />        <br />"

They may prefer to stroll outdoors, prune plants, sweep the porch, sand wood or, for example, work on a word game. Individual Pursuits have been created with these individuals in mind.

Based on personal and historic information, ETT programs are developed to help residents socialize and share with others. Each ETT program is personalized based on cognitive and functional ability.

However, some conditions which cause dementia symptoms can be reversed, including depression, side effects of medication, excessive alcohol use and vitamin deficiencies. There are other forms of dementia linked to types of dementia that affect a significant segment of the population. These people may benefit from living in a memory care community.",

From the welcoming nature in the lobby complete with punch and cookies to the colorful and stimulating stations in the central hub of the building, the visitors benefit from the positive energy present almost as much as the residents who live there. The lovely grounds provide an ongoing opportunity to leave the building without the resident having to exert too much effort.</blockquote>\n    \n\n\n                            \n    \n    \n        <blockquote>The attentiveness of the direct care staff is evident in their constant interaction with all the residents. Mom had always been more of a solitary intellectual through the years, but in a short amount of time her caregivers found the right combination of people for Mom to dine with at each meal. She is more engaged at Arden Courts… Arden Courts also deserves the highest marks for the specific population they serve – those left vulnerable with dementia or Alzheimer’s disease.</blockquote>\n    \n\n\n                            \n    \n    \n        <blockquote>While adjusting to her environment during the first week, I stayed during lunch to acquaint the staff with her eating habits.

Alzheimer’s disease afflicts between 60% to 80% of all individuals experiencing dementia. Most changes in the brain that cause dementia are permanent and progressive. However, some conditions which cause dementia symptoms can be reversed, including depression, side effects of medication, excessive alcohol use and vitamin deficiencies. There are other forms of dementia linked to types of dementia that affect a significant segment of the population. These people may benefit from living in a memory care community.",

Medicare is designed to cover health care costs in the short term usually following a hospital stay and if the individual requires skilled nursing or rehabilitation services. Medicare doesn't cover all expenses and is not designed to pay for long-term custodial care, so it’s important to understand the program. Our team can help explain this further.",

However, some conditions which cause dementia symptoms can be reversed, including depression, side effects of medication, excessive alcohol use and vitamin deficiencies. There are other forms of dementia linked to types of dementia that affect a significant segment of the population. These people may benefit from living in a memory care community.",

That is why the choice of a memory care community is phenomenally important. We found that Anita runs an optimal community at Arden Courts of Fair Oaks. Anita inspires and directs her staff with clarity and purposeful service; she encourages and counsels family members through the difficult decisions and helps us connect to one another as well as to auxiliary resources. Most importantly, she creates a home environment where our parent can live her best possible life.</blockquote>\n    \n\n\n                            \n    \n    \n        <blockquote>Our mother, Betty, resided at Arden Courts from October 2012 through October 2017. Her departure was precipitated by the need to move her to Virginia Beach with our father. If we could have taken Arden Courts to Virginia Beach, we would have! The five years we have collaborated with Anita and Arden Courts staff have included countless special events, large and small, accompanied by attentive care that truly extended beyond mom to the entire family.

However, some conditions which cause dementia symptoms can be reversed, including depression, side effects of medication, excessive alcohol use and vitamin deficiencies. There are other forms of dementia linked to types of dementia that affect a significant segment of the population. These people may benefit from living in a memory care community.",

There are visual cues everywhere. Symbols and colors help our residents avoid confusion, stay oriented and remain as independent as possible. Descriptive photos can often take the place of language and signs. These cues are designed not only to help residents effortlessly navigate the halls and pathways, but also to stimulate memory and create triggers.<br />        <br />",

It was one of the hardest decisions my family and I ever had to make. My sisters and I took care of my mother by rotating in and out of her home for years prior to placing her at Arden Courts. The anxiety, fear and guilt that went along with that decision were immense. We were overwhelmed with the constant care of my mother and trying to care for our own families and work. My mother had Alzheimer’s, and watching her deteriorate both mentally and physically was emotionally difficult. At the time we made the decision to place her, she did not believe that her home was her home anymore.</blockquote>\n    \n\n\n                            \n    \n    \n        <blockquote>The people at Arden Courts were phenomenal. From our initial visit with the intake staff, we felt that the folks there genuinely cared, and more importantly understood my mother’s issues. They were so patient and sensitive. Between the exhaustion and the weight of the decision, I know that we cried on them on more than one occasion. They were patient and understanding. They guided us through the process and patiently answered our myriad of questions. On moving day, there was staff to assist so we were able to move my mother’s things out of her home and into her new room while we took her to lunch with minimal disruption and added confusion to her.</blockquote>\n    \n\n\n                            \n    \n    \n        <blockquote>I am a nurse, so as you might expect, I monitored my mother’s care closely. At no time did the staff seem threatened or insulted by my input. They were consummate professionals. I really felt that the family and staff were a team in my mother’s care. But most important was how they cared for these residents. I was utterly in awe of their ability to maintain such a caring attitude and have abundant patience in such a stressful, sometimes downright crazy, environment. Each staff member knew not only the names of the folks on their unit but also the names of all the residents in all of the wings. I watched staff take the time to console these confused souls despite them being so busy themselves. It wasn’t just the names they knew. They knew what these residents’ habits were and likes and dislikes. They always had a smile for everyone, even the ones who didn’t smile back or were ornery. I liked how they joked and teased with them. My mother loved that, and it made her feel more at home than like she was a patient.</blockquote>\n    \n\n\n                            \n    \n    \n        <blockquote>Your facility was perfect. Everyone has their own room to go into when they want to be alone or use the bathroom, yet there is a dayroom to be with the other residents. The activities were great. It was also nice that the residents could say no to the activities. My mother was not fond of most of them but would attend some of the musical activities. The folks there were also amazingly patient with an often vocal one or two trying to disrupt the presentation or with the folks who merely go to sleep there. My mother was particularly fond of the street-like environment of the hallways. She loved to walk. Being able to have the freedom to walk a long distance there without interruption was great. The trick of course was finding her once it was meal time. And she did love meal time. Your cooks were the best. The food was tender enough so it could be chewed easily without being bland and boring. My mother often commented on how great the food was there. She ate more there than she did at home.</blockquote>\n    \n\n\n                            \n    \n    \n        <blockquote>In the end, while my mother was in hospice care, I felt that my family and I were cared for as much as my mother was. Our ability to be at her bedside most of the time helped us to process her impending death. The staff’s responsiveness to her pain and agitation was amazing again given the environment.

However, some conditions which cause dementia symptoms can be reversed, including depression, side effects of medication, excessive alcohol use and vitamin deficiencies. There are other forms of dementia linked to types of dementia that affect a significant segment of the population. These people may benefit from living in a memory care community.",

As a family, we’d worked carefully to be certain Dad would be all right following Mom’s death four years ago. Even at age 85, he continued to be very active and worked every day at his [insurance] office in Milford, Ohio. About two years ago, dementia began to creep into Dad’s day-to-day living, and it accelerated as time went on. We were able to move Dad from the home he’d been in for over 50 years into [a provider] in Milford for about a year and a half. Soon, though, Dad began to have more serious memory issues and had begun to fall from time to time. Arden Courts was then highly recommended for Dad, and we hustled to get him transitioned into the Kenwood facility; we had no idea how quickly he would decline.</blockquote>\n    \n\n\n                            \n    \n    \n        <blockquote>The full staff at Arden Courts was beyond outstanding – friendly, understanding, professional. As a family, we were there frequently and always impressed with the sensitive care on the part of the Arden Courts staff. As things became more difficult for Dad, the Arden Courts group always knew the right thing to do, and this gave us great comfort. The final few weeks for Dad were very difficult for him with the dementia and congestive heart failure. Again, Arden Courts was able to compensate and make the needed adjustments, even when we needed to bring hospice help in the last few days. All in all, the entire stay and care for Dad could not have gone any better.</blockquote>\n    \n\n\n                            \n    \n    \n        <blockquote>I know these comments are how each of the five children feels with respect to Arden Courts and the staff there. I sincerely wanted to pass on this feedback to the staff at Arden Courts and possibly for other families to reference, as well.</blockquote>\n    \n\n\n                </div>\n            </div>        </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n                </div>\n    </div>\n\n\n\t                  <a class=\"close-icon popup_wordsofa1_close\">\n\t                    <img src=\"/css/images/x-close-navy.svg\" alt=\"close-icon\">\n\t                </a>\n\t            "

They may prefer to stroll outdoors, prune plants, sweep the porch, sand wood or, for example, work on a word game. Individual Pursuits have been created with these individuals in mind.

Based on personal and historic information, ETT programs are developed to help residents socialize and share with others. Each ETT program is personalized based on cognitive and functional ability.

The environment is carefully created with scents of lavender, soft music, nature scenes, hydration and nurturing for attention to the senses of smell, touch, taste, hearing and vision.<br />        <br />"

Living with Alzheimer’s or a related dementia presents a myriad of challenges for which most families are unprepared. The demands placed on caregivers are intense and can seriously impact the caregiver’s lifestyle and personal health.",
          "whatIs": "Dementia simply means a decline in memory and is a general term used to describe a wide range of conditions and symptoms. Alzheimer’s disease afflicts between 60% to 80% of all individuals experiencing dementia. Most changes in the brain that cause dementia are permanent and progressive. However, some conditions which cause dementia symptoms can be reversed, including depression, side effects of medication, excessive alcohol use and vitamin deficiencies. There are other forms of dementia linked to types of dementia that affect a significant segment of the population. These people may benefit from living in a memory care community.",

Dementia is caused by damage to brain cells, and the reasons for the damage can also vary greatly.",

The community is comprised of four self-contained “houses” in which residents live in private bedrooms with half baths. Each house has its own common living areas, kitchen and full bath. All four of the houses share an activity and craft studio, barber and beauty salon and wellness center. The houses are arranged around a safe and secure landscaped backyard in which residents enjoy the beauty of the outdoors utilizing the sitting areas, courtyards, porch and paved walking paths. Residents can move about safely and freely throughout the community, indoors and outdoors, without feeling restricted. Liberal use of color-coded visual cues, photos and symbols, both in the courtyard and indoor areas, act as navigational markers to help residents stay oriented and maximize their independence.

However, some conditions which cause dementia symptoms can be reversed, including depression, side effects of medication, excessive alcohol use and vitamin deficiencies. There are other forms of dementia linked to types of dementia that affect a significant segment of the population. These people may benefit from living in a memory care community.",

I have been going there for my job going on seven years now. I must say that the staff there is not only efficient, professional and competent, but they make people feel special when you walk in the front door. I cannot tell you how many times I found the staff doing thoughtful things for the residents in the facility. They make an impact on these people’s lives. They are hands-on, and know and care about all of their residents.

Living with Alzheimer’s or a related dementia presents a myriad of challenges for which most families are unprepared. The demands placed on caregivers are intense and can seriously impact the caregiver’s lifestyle and personal health.",
          "whatIs": "Dementia simply means a decline in memory and is a general term used to describe a wide range of conditions and symptoms. Alzheimer’s disease afflicts between 60% to 80% of all individuals experiencing dementia. Most changes in the brain that cause dementia are permanent and progressive. However, some conditions which cause dementia symptoms can be reversed, including depression, side effects of medication, excessive alcohol use and vitamin deficiencies. There are other forms of dementia linked to types of dementia that affect a significant segment of the population. These people may benefit from living in a memory care community.",

Dementia is caused by damage to brain cells, and the reasons for the damage can also vary greatly.",

They may prefer to stroll outdoors, prune plants, sweep the porch, sand wood or, for example, work on a word game. Individual Pursuits have been created with these individuals in mind.

Jeni inquired with the Lab Department at the hospital, wondering if anyone would remember Nance.&nbsp; Past co-workers Diane Lee and Kathleen Peters along with many other team members said they did not just “remember” Nance but they kind of grew up with Nance and considered her both a mentor and friend.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n                            \n    \n<p>The team members did so much more than Joanne ever imagined.&nbsp; They assembled a photo album for Nance which depicted the history and good times of the Lab Department where Nance once worked.&nbsp; Nance will be presented with the album along with the opportunity to speak to some of the “girls from the hospital” as part of her Heart’s Desire and 100<sup>th</sup> Birthday Celebration.</p>\n\n\n                            \n    \n<p><em>If you are interested in joining our Heart’s Desire event on Monday, March 21, 2022, contact Maryanne Fisher, Memory Care Advisor, at 727-771-1600.</em></p>\n<p>Arden Courts ProMedica Memory Care is located 2895 Tampa Road, Palm Harbor, Florida and is proud to be part of ProMedica, a mission-based, not-for-profit integrated healthcare organization which includes a network of 13 hospitals, 2,600 physicians, a health plan, 300 skilled nursing and rehabilitation centers, memory care communities, home health and hospice agencies.

There are visual cues everywhere. Symbols and colors help our residents avoid confusion, stay oriented and remain as independent as possible. Descriptive photos can often take the place of language and signs. These cues are designed not only to help residents effortlessly navigate the halls and pathways, but also to stimulate memory and create triggers.<br />        <br />",

She took up painting after visiting the National Gallery of Art, where she was inspired by the works of the Jewish-Italian painter Amedeo Modigliani. Karin is a featured artist and member of Potomac Artists in Touch (PAinT), a diverse group of local artist dedicated to cultivating the visual arts in the Potomac, Maryland community. She has worked mostly in oils. Her style includes impressionistic, expressionistic and abstract art, representing figures, still life and landscapes.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>To learn how you can get a copy of our 2016 Heart of Art calendar contact the <a href=\"http://www.hcr-manorcare.com/find-a-location/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Find a Location\">location closest to you</a>.</p>\n\n\n                </div>\n            </div>        </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n                </div>\n    </div>\n\n\n\t\t                  <a class=\"close-icon popup_firstPost_close\">\n\t\t                    <img src=\"/css/images/x-close-navy.svg\" alt=\"close-icon\">\n\t\t                </a>\n\t\t            "

However, some conditions which cause dementia symptoms can be reversed, including depression, side effects of medication, excessive alcohol use and vitamin deficiencies. There are other forms of dementia linked to types of dementia that affect a significant segment of the population. These people may benefit from living in a memory care community.",

However, some conditions which cause dementia symptoms can be reversed, including depression, side effects of medication, excessive alcohol use and vitamin deficiencies. There are other forms of dementia linked to types of dementia that affect a significant segment of the population. These people may benefit from living in a memory care community.",

Descriptive photos can often take the place of language and signs. These cues are designed not only to help residents effortlessly navigate the halls and pathways, but also to stimulate memory and create triggers.<br />        <br />",

Taylor was very patient with my questions and helped me work through the decision process. Denise gave me a personal tour and provided great insight gleaned from years of experience dealing with dementia residents. David helped prepare Dad’s room and help me get what was needed to make it home for Dad. Tina was very reassuring as we transitioned Dad’s health care from Atlanta to Tampa. She kept me informed about any health issues.</blockquote>\n    \n\n\n                            \n    \n    \n        <blockquote>Since Dad lost his independence in 2014, he was never more happy than his short time at Arden Courts. Your staff provided loving care and reassurance to me as I dealt with new issues while Dad’s dementia progressed. Taylor, in particular, exceeded my expectations in her patience and sincere concern for Dad and me. It was obvious the whole staff enjoyed their work and were skilled at dealing with dementia patients. Sylee is the caregiver who worked the most with Dad. She was always smiling and reassuring. She handled things I never could, and she enjoyed caring for Dad.</blockquote>\n    \n\n\n                            \n    \n    \n        <blockquote>I will highly recommend Arden Courts of Tampa to friends seeking memory care services.

There are visual cues everywhere. Symbols and colors help our residents avoid confusion, stay oriented and remain as independent as possible. Descriptive photos can often take the place of language and signs. These cues are designed not only to help residents effortlessly navigate the halls and pathways, but also to stimulate memory and create triggers.<br />        <br />",

However, some conditions which cause dementia symptoms can be reversed, including depression, side effects of medication, excessive alcohol use and vitamin deficiencies. There are other forms of dementia linked to types of dementia that affect a significant segment of the population. These people may benefit from living in a memory care community.",

Medicare is designed to cover health care costs in the short term usually following a hospital stay and if the individual requires skilled nursing or rehabilitation services. Medicare doesn't cover all expenses and is not designed to pay for long-term custodial care, so it’s important to understand the program. Our team can help explain this further.",

However, some conditions which cause dementia symptoms can be reversed, including depression, side effects of medication, excessive alcohol use and vitamin deficiencies. There are other forms of dementia linked to types of dementia that affect a significant segment of the population. These people may benefit from living in a memory care community.",

My mother entered your Winter Springs location just over six years ago after spending two years in another Alzheimer/dementia care facility in Ohio. She resided in the Winter Springs Arden Courts facility until her death just under two months ago. During this time, I made it my goal to visit my mother and the staff on a weekly basis and to attend the periodic special events they sponsored.</blockquote>\n    \n\n\n                            \n    \n    \n        <blockquote>Throughout my mother’s stay at your Winter Springs location, I was continually impressed with the people, leadership and operation of the facility. The facility was run in a professional manner by a staff that treated all of the residents as family. They were attentive to details, took responsibility for any mistakes and persevered through the constant challenges. Throughout the past six years, I have had the peace of mind that my mother was being taken care of in the best way possible and that she was being treated with dignity and respect. I have often wondered what I would have done without your facility and the tremendous group of people that have provided care for her over the past six years. The care at this facility far exceeded the care that I could have provided in my own home, not to mention the challenges that would have been created for my own family, businesses and charitable efforts. I credit these positive attributes of the culture in the Winter Springs facility to the leadership there.</blockquote>\n    \n\n\n                            \n    \n    \n        <blockquote>They are a group of people who care deeply about human life regardless of the residents’ ability to appreciate the care being given to them. They continue to provide the same level of care in spite of the resident being difficult or even hostile. I think it is fair to say that I am a better man for witnessing the selfless care the Winter Springs staff provided to difficult people over the past six years. I was both humbled and inspired by these folks serving in the face of sickness and continual losses, and I sometimes wondered how they could face death so often and yet remain so friendly and cheerful.</blockquote>\n    \n\n\n                            \n    \n    \n        <blockquote>I have recommended Arden Courts to countless friends who are dealing with family members with the same issues as my mother had.</blockquote>\n    \n\n\n                </div>\n            </div>        </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n                </div>\n    </div>\n\n\n\t                  <a class=\"close-icon popup_wordsofa1_close\">\n\t                    <img src=\"/css/images/x-close-navy.svg\" alt=\"close-icon\">\n\t                </a>\n\t            "

They may prefer to stroll outdoors, prune plants, sweep the porch, sand wood or, for example, work on a word game. Individual Pursuits have been created with these individuals in mind.

Based on personal and historic information, ETT programs are developed to help residents socialize and share with others. Each ETT program is personalized based on cognitive and functional ability.

They may prefer to stroll outdoors, prune plants, sweep the porch, sand wood or, for example, work on a word game. Individual Pursuits have been created with these individuals in mind.

Based on personal and historic information, ETT programs are developed to help residents socialize and share with others. Each ETT program is personalized based on cognitive and functional ability.

The Science Museum of Virginia features four floors of interactive labs, awesome artifacts, and hundreds of hands-on experiences. We explored the Skin: Living Armor, Evolving Identity exhibit where residents learned about the skin’s role in shaping human culture and identity. The Speed exhibit was one of our favorites, displaying engaging demonstrations of the superfast to the incredibly slow, you can race an Olympic athlete or feel hurricane-force winds.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Engagement is a term used in both love and war. It is a term designating the promise made before a wedding as well as a term objectifying battle. As we age, we are less likely to use the term unless we are looking for memory care for a loved one. Why then?</p>\n<p>Because in quality memory care, engagement is the term used for dementia-specific life-enriching activities. As our loved ones’ brains change, their ability to participate in what once was easy changes as well. Traditional programs geared to interest are too generic for them. They are not truly engaged.</p>\n<p>Research shows that dementia-specific engagement actually delays the progression of cognitive loss. Individuals with dementia engaged in an active lifestyle maintain cognition longer. An active lifestyle for an individual with dementia includes preference and dementia-specific engagement.</p>\n<p>There are many memory care communities with a promise of engagement backed by a nice logo, but with little staffing, training or commitment. Walk through on an evening or weekend and see for yourself. An empty promise.</p>\n<p>Whether it is Engagement Therapy Treatment™, or Namaste, Arden Courts’ focuses on optimizing cognitive strength regardless of where the individual’s skill level is. Matching skill, preferences and training to create a quality of life unrivaled by other memory communities.</p>\n<p>At Arden Courts, engagement is much more than a promise. Plan a tour today to see it in action.</p>\n\n\n                </div>\n            </div>        </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n                </div>\n    </div>\n\n\n\t\t                  <a class=\"close-icon popup_firstPost_close\">\n\t\t                    <img src=\"/css/images/x-close-navy.svg\" alt=\"close-icon\">\n\t\t                </a>\n\t\t            "

They may prefer to stroll outdoors, prune plants, sweep the porch, sand wood or, for example, work on a word game. Individual Pursuits have been created with these individuals in mind. Many, including individuals diagnosed with atypical dementias, often benefit from individual pursuits versus large group programming.<br />        <br />",

Based on personal and historic information, ETT programs are developed to help residents socialize and share with others. Each ETT program is personalized based on cognitive and functional ability.

Everyday tasks such as making the bed, performing light housekeeping, setting the table and folding the laundry are all examples of life skills programming. Successful completion of familiar tasks can help residents feel productive and good about themselves.<br />        <br />",

The environment is carefully created with scents of lavender, soft music, nature scenes, hydration and nurturing for attention to the senses of smell, touch, taste, hearing and vision.<br />        <br />"

However, some conditions which cause dementia symptoms can be reversed, including depression, side effects of medication, excessive alcohol use and vitamin deficiencies.

There are visual cues everywhere. Symbols and colors help our residents avoid confusion, stay oriented and remain as independent as possible. Descriptive photos can often take the place of language and signs. These cues are designed not only to help residents effortlessly navigate the halls and pathways, but also to stimulate memory and create triggers.<br />        <br />",
