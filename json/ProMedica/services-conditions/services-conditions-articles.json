      "articleContent": "Understanding Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm (AAA)<br />Your aorta is your body’s main blood vessel that runs from your heart through the center of your chest and stomach (abdomen). It’s your body’s main supplier of blood, and a rupture to it can cause life-threatening bleeding.<br />This rupture commonly happens when the aorta’s thick wall is weakened or damaged. It forms a bulge or a balloon, called an aneurysm. Though an aneurysm can occur in any blood vessel, they occur most often in the abdominal (stomach) portion of the aorta. This is called an abdominal aortic aneurysm.<br />Call us today at <a href='tel:+18003956278'>1-800-39-JOBST (56278)</a> to schedule an appointment.<br />What are the symptoms of an abdominal aortic aneurysm?<br />Though three out of four people show no symptoms, some people feel stomach or low back pain.<br />Who’s at risk for an abdominal aortic aneurysm?<br />Men over the age of 60 have the highest occurrence.<br />Family history increases your risk.<br />Chances increase if you have <a href='/services-and-conditions/high-blood-pressure-hypertension'>high blood pressure.</a><br />Risk gets higher if you smoke.<br />Chances increase with age.<br />What are my options if I have an abdominal aortic aneurysm?<br />Your vascular surgeon will recommend specific tests and treatment based on the size of the aneurysm and how fast it’s growing. Treatment may include monitoring, surgical repair, or endovascular stent graft repair.<br />",

Whether it's a specific food or an environmental factor, identifying the source of your allergies is an important step toward managing your symptoms and feeling your best. After thorough allergy testing, our experts can help you understand what's triggering your symptoms and develop a treatment plan designed to help prevent allergic reactions and reduce your discomfort.<br /><a href='/find-a-doctor/provider-results?SpecialtyId=86&amp;SpecialtyText=Allergy%20and%20Immunology'>View our Allergy and Immunology Specialists</a>.<br />Other Conditions We Treat<br />Our allergy and immunology expertise encompasses a number of other conditions. Together, we can identify common sensitivities and help you get your symptoms under control.<br /><a href='#faq1'>Asthma</a><br />Whether you're living with ongoing asthma or your symptoms develop only when you get sick or encounter certain allergens, seeking treatment is recommended. We will create a treatment plan to provide short term relief and long-term control of your asthma symptoms.<br /><a href='#faq2'>Children's Asthma</a><br />Asthma is a common and growing condition among school-aged children. For a child suffering from asthma, every day brings new challenges and the fear that breathing could become difficult at any time.<br />Our goal is to help families overcome the limitations and debilitating symptoms associated with childhood asthma. With comprehensive treatment we provide, the frequency and severity of asthma symptoms may be reduced, allowing your child to a more active life.<br /><a href='#faq3'>Sinus Issues</a><br />Are you plagued by chronic sinus infections, sinus headaches, blockages or other unbearable sinus issues? Sinus conditions can be caused by many things, from allergies to anatomical factors. And the symptoms of sinus problems can include snoring, congestion, debilitating headaches and obstructed breathing, among others. Our providers can diagnose and treat sinus issues.<br /><a href='#faq4'>Skin Conditions</a><br />Contact Dermatitis<br />Contact dermatitis is a type of rash that causes your skin to get red, itch, and in some cases, feel like it’s burning. There are two main classifications for contact dermatitis - allergic and irritant. While the triggers for each are different, the reactions and treatment recommendations are very similar.<br />Most of the time, contact dermatitis can be treated at home, but in some cases you may need to see a specialist. After a few days, if the rash has not responded to treatment and is painful, you should contact our office to be seen.<br />Hives<br />Hives can be caused by a number of factors, from bug bites to food reactions to environmental triggers. And unfortunately, hives can be itchy and irritating, causing undue amounts of discomfort. We will analyze your condition and recommend solutions to alleviate the symptoms associated with hives outbreaks.<br />Ezcema<br />Eczema (also called atopic dermatitis) affects between 15 and 20 percent of school-age children and as many as 10 percent of adults. This chronic condition causes itchy, inflamed skin that is sometimes accompanied by asthma or allergy symptoms. Although some over-the-counter treatments can be helpful in treating and preventing eczema flare-ups, professional dermatologic care often offers the best results. Our skincare team can help you gain control of your eczema and experience increased confidence and improved quality of life.<br />",

      "about": "<a></a><br />Understanding Alzheimer’s Disease and Dementia<br /><a href='#collapse1'>Recognizing the Symptoms</a><br />Dementia is a term that describes different diseases and symptoms related to brain functions, such as memory loss or problem-solving skills.<br />Alzheimer’s disease is a progressive type of dementia, which means the person’s memory gets worse over time. No one knows exactly what causes Alzheimer’s disease. Genes, lifestyle habits and overall health may all play a role.<br />Alzheimer’s disease symptoms develop differently in each person. Most people live for an average of eight years after symptoms appear, but some people can live as long as 20 years with the disease.<br />Alzheimer’s disease typically affects people over age 65. In rare cases, it appears in people under age 60. This condition is called early onset Alzheimer’s disease.<br />Common Alzheimer’s disease symptoms can include:<br />Decision making problems.<br />Difficulty with judgement.<br />Language difficulties.<br />Memory problems.<br />Personality changes.<br /><a href='#collapse2'>Diagnosis</a><br />If it’s suspected you or a loved one may have Alzheimer’s disease, your doctor will start with a physical exam. During this exam, he or she will ask about your or your loved one’s medical history, medications and any family history of dementia or Alzheimer’s disease.<br />You or your loved one may also undergo several tests, including:<br />Imaging tests, such as an MRI or PET scan.<br />Lab testing, such as blood tests.<br />Mental status testing.<br />Neuropsychological tests.<br /><a href='#collapse3'>Stages of Alzheimer’s Disease</a><br />There are four stages of Alzheimer’s disease, with three of the stages having symptoms. These stages help doctors and caregivers make decisions on how to care for someone with Alzheimer’s disease.<br />It’s important to remember that not every case of Alzheimer’s disease is the same. Each person moves through symptoms and stages differently.<br />Preclinical stage<br />This is the earliest stage of Alzheimer’s disease. During this stage, the brain is undergoing changes that will later lead to cognitive symptoms, such as memory loss. The preclinical stage can last for many years before symptoms appear.<br />Mild, early stage<br />Forgetfulness is the most common symptom in the early stage of Alzheimer’s disease, but it’s often misunderstood as a common sign of aging. A person at this stage can still live independently, but may have problems with:<br />Concentration.<br />Making plans.<br />Managing money.<br />Recalling recent events.<br />Remembering a name.<br />Remembering where a valuable object is stored.<br />Staying organized.<br />Moderate, middle stage<br />The middle stage of Alzheimer’s disease is usually the longest stage and can last for many years. At this stage, symptoms can include:<br />Becoming moody or withdrawn, or having personality changes, such as hallucinations, paranoia or delusions.<br />Feeling restless, agitated, anxious or tearful, especially in the late afternoon or at night.<br />Having trouble remembering events.<br />Having trouble remembering names of familiar people, such as a spouse or a child.<br />Losing track of time and place.<br />Needing help with daily activities, such as getting dressed or brushing teeth.<br />Problems learning new things.<br />Problems with reading, writing and working with numbers.<br />Sleep problems.<br />Trouble remembering one’s name, but not details about one’s life, such as address and phone number.<br />Trouble with planning complicated events, like a dinner.<br />Severe, late stage<br />Most people at this stage need around-the-clock caregiving. During this stage of the disease a person may:<br />Be more likely to get infections, especially pneumonia.<br />Be unaware of his or her surroundings.<br />Lose bowel and bladder control.<br />Lose the ability to walk, sit or eat.<br />Need help with activities all of the time.<br />Say some words or phrases but cannot have a conversation.<br /><a href='#collapse4'>Stages of Dementia</a><br />There are seven stages of dementia used to describe a person’s progression through the disease that help doctors and caregivers make decisions about treatment.<br />Stage 1<br />When a person is in stage 1 dementia, they have no signs of cognitive decline and don’t show any problems with memory.<br />Stage 2<br />Although there often aren’t any signs evident during the doctor interview, people in the second stage of dementia may complain about forgetfulness and very mild cognitive decline. Many people with stage 2 dementia are still able to complete tasks and function socially.<br />Stage 3<br />A person at this stage has started to show early signs of confusion and family members may start to notice symptoms, including:<br />Memory loss during doctor testing.<br />Some denial about their condition.<br />Trouble remembering names of new people.<br />Stage 4<br />At this stage, a person will continue to show early signs of confusion and problems with cognitive function will become more noticeable. However, most people at this stage are still aware of time and location. Symptoms can include:<br />Being unaware of current and recent events.<br />Problems concentrating.<br />Trouble remembering events from his or her personal history.<br />Using denial as a main defense mechanism when asked about symptoms or problems.<br />Stage 5<br />This stage indicates early dementia. While those with stage 5 dementia may be able to eat and use the bathroom on their own, they start to show signs of moderate to severe cognitive problems, including:<br />Being unable to recall major events in his or her life.<br />Feeling disoriented in time or place.<br />Feeling tearful.<br />Having trouble sleeping.<br />Needing help with choosing what to wear.<br />Occasionally dressing improperly.<br />Resisting the need for caregiving.<br />Wandering around and looking for a way out of the room or building.<br />Stage 6<br />At this stage, a person shows severe cognitive problems and isn’t able to live independently. He or she may:<br />Be unable to recall most recent events.<br />Have problems bathing.<br />Have sleeping problems.<br />Not be able to complete two-step commands.<br />Only eat with assistance.<br />Remove or not wear clothing properly.<br />Repeat conversations.<br />Show great resistance to caregiving.<br />Wander on purpose.<br />Stage 7<br />In the final and most severe stage of dementia, people aren’t able to easily communicate or function on their own, and may:<br />Not be able to complete simple tasks.<br />Not be able to eat on his or her own.<br />Not be able to hold his or her head up.<br />Not be able to sit up or walk independently.<br />Not smile.<br />Speak very little; sometimes as little as one word a day.<br />",

      "articleContent": "About Angiography<br />Angiography is an x-ray study of the arteries. This procedure involves injecting a contrast material (x-ray dye) into a blood vessel to make it visible on an x-ray. The dye is placed directly in the artery through a very small flexible tube called a catheter, which is inserted in to the artery through a small nick in the skin.<br />The procedure is often used to detect abnormalities of the blood vessels, such as narrowing and blockage caused by fatty deposits or blood clots, and aneurysms (defined as weakening or ballooning of the wall of the artery). Angiography can also detect abnormal patterns of blood vessels caused by tumors and can show sites of internal bleeding. Demonstrating these blood vessel abnormalities can help the physician determine the extent of the disease and determine the best treatment option.<br />",

Our anticoagulation service helps people who take an anticoagulant (blood thinner to prevent blood clots) safely and effectively manage their medication. It has been shown that patients who are monitored by an anticoagulation service receive the most effective treatment to reduce their risk of new blood clots or bleeding.<br />Warfarin is dosed based on your international normalized ratio (INR) which is the number of seconds it takes for your blood to clot.<br />Other anticoagulants such as Lovenox, Eliquis, and Xarelto can be measured by Anti-Xa levels to determine the amount of drug in the body that blocks the clotting factor Xa.<br />All of these medications are monitored based on your kidney function, liver function, and other lab results. Overall lifestyle and other medications you take can also affect your anticoagulant medication so we will work closely with you to make sure that you are taking the safest and most effective dose for you.<br />Why do people take an anticoagulant?<br />An anticoagulant is prescribed to prevent harmful blood clots from forming or to treat an existing blood clot.

      "articleContent": "<br />What Is Arrhythmia?<br />Arrhythmia is an irregular heart rate or rhythm that causes poor blood flow to your body. Some arrhythmias increase your risk for having a stroke. If you or for a loved one is diagnosed with arrhythmia, it’s natural to have questions. A ProMedica electrophysiologist in the Toledo area can help you determine whether you or a loved one are experiencing arrhythmia.<br />Understanding Arrhythmia<br /><a href='#faq1'>What are the most common kinds of arrhythmia?</a><br /><a href='/services-and-conditions/atrial-fibrillation-afib'>Atrial fibrillation (AFib)</a>: Fast, irregular heartbeat.<br />Tachycardia: Fast, but regular heartbeat.<br />Bradycardia: A slow heartbeat.<br /><a href='#faq2'>How does arrhythmia work?</a><br />The heart is an electrical pump. Normally, electrical impulses start every beat of your heart and keep your heart beating with a nice, regular rhythm.<br />But sometimes those rhythms become chaotic, irregular or rapid. The upper parts of your heart get out of sync with the lower parts of your heart.<br /><a href='#faq3'>How does arrhythmia feel?</a><br />Some people have no symptoms at all, while some have different sensations. You may notice these feelings occasionally, often, or all of the time. You may describe the feeling in your chest like this:<br />A fish flopping<br />A drum pounding<br />Butterflies fluttering<br />Your heart leaping out of your chest<br />Your heart skipping a beat, and then your heart racing<br />You may also feel:<br />Lightheaded<br />Nervous<br />Out of breath<br />Weak<br />Dizzy<br />Tired<br /><a href='#faq4'>What causes arrhythmia?</a><br />Electrical flaws or damage to the heart are the most common causes. However some people with arrhythmia have none of these.<br />Why should you be concerned? <br /> Arrhythmia, especially AFib, increases your risk for stroke by five times that of a person without arrhythmia. Your atypical heartbeat allows blood to pool in your heart, where a blood clot can form. Eventually the clot may dislodge and travel to your brain. This causes a stroke.<br />ProMedica’s cardiac electrophysiologists have the expertise to help you determine the best diagnosis and treatment for your arrhythmia.<br /><a href='#faq5'>What is a cardiac electrophysiologist?</a><br />This specially trained cardiologist treats patients who have rhythm problems with their hearts.<br /><a href='/services-and-conditions/electrophysiology'>Learn more about cardiac electrophysiology</a><br />",

This recognition puts us in the company of fewer than a dozen organizations in the United States to achieve this certification. We meet the highest national standards for quality and safety in asthma diagnosis, treatment and education.<br />Childhood asthma in Lucas County is widespread. It affects 5% of children under the age of five, 15% of children under the age of 11, and 21% of children in grades 6 through 12. Of children diagnosed with asthma, 32% are African American.<br />At ProMedica Ebeid Children’s Hospital, the goal of our asthma program is to help minimize the frequency and severity of a child’s symptoms. Working directly with affected children and their families, we help them understand and manage their condition. This reduces their risk for emergency room and hospital visits, and improves quality of life. Our patient care program offers a wide spectrum of services and support, including:<br />Controller medicines to decrease symptoms and prevent asthma attacks.<br />Education on personal asthma triggers, such as allergies, smoke, exercise and cold air.<br />How to understand the differences among medicines and how to take the right one at the right time.<br />Personalized Asthma Action Plans to help monitor and manage symptoms and document key healthcare contacts.

While an irregular heartbeat isn’t always dangerous, the side effects can raise your risk for a stroke.<br />During AFib, the electrical signal that starts the heartbeat gets jumbled. This causes the upper chambers of the heart (atria) to contract and relax irregularly. The heart’s upper chambers get out of sync with the lower chambers (ventricles) and the heart can’t pump blood efficiently.<br />When the heart can’t pump blood properly, the blood pools in the upper chambers. At some point, this pooled blood may form a blood clot. If the blood clot escapes the heart and gets stuck in an artery leading to the brain, it can cause a <a href='/services-and-conditions/stroke'>stroke</a>.<br /><a href='/assets/documents/services-pdfs/afib-fact-sheet.pdf'>Get the facts on AFib with our fact sheet.</a><br /><a href='#collapse2'>Risk Factors</a><br />AFib is more common in women and people over age 65. Certain foods and substances, such as caffeine and alcohol, can also cause attacks.<br />Other risk factors include:<br />Congenital heart defects.<br />Diabetes.<br />Heart failure.<br />Heart surgery.<br />High blood pressure.<br />Obesity (overweight).<br />Obstructive sleep apnea.<br />Thyroid disease and thyroid medicines.<br /><a href='/assets/documents/services-pdfs/afib_risk_checklist.pdf'>Are you at risk for atrial fibrillation?

      "diagnosis": "<a></a><br />Diagnosis &amp; Treatment<br /><a href='#collapse3'>Symptoms</a><br />Atrial fibrillation symptoms can vary from person to person, range from mild to severe and, in some cases, may not cause any symptoms at all.<br />Common symptoms can include:<br />Chest pain.<br />Confusion.<br />Dizziness.<br />Fatigue.<br />Pounding or fluttering in the chest (palpitations).<br />Shortness of breath.<br />Trouble exercising.<br />Weakness.<br /><a href='#collapse4'>Diagnosis</a><br />If your doctor believes you may have atrial fibrillation, you’ll have a physical exam. During this exam, your doctor will ask you about your health history and your family’s health history, as well as any medicines you may be taking.<br />Your doctor may also refer you to a cardiac electrophysiologist. These doctors specialize in treating the heart’s electrical system and heart rhythm problems like atrial fibrillation.<br />After a physical exam, your doctor may also ask you to have several tests, including:<br />Blood tests: These tests can help your doctor figure out whether another condition is causing the atrial fibrillation.<br />Echocardiogram: This is an ultrasound of the heart. Your doctor may use an echocardiogram to check your heart’s structure and how it’s pumping blood.<br />Electrocardiogram (EKG or ECG): This test checks your heart’s rhythm and whether it’s sending and receiving electrical signals properly. If your atrial fibrillation comes and goes, your doctor may ask you to wear a portable electrocardiogram (Holter monitor) for a few days at home.<br />Stress test: During this test, you will walk or run on a treadmill while your doctor monitors your heart and blood pressure. It can help show how blood flows to and from your heart.<br /><a href='#collapse5'>Treatment</a><br />If you’ve been diagnosed with AFib, your doctor may decide to treat the condition with medicines, minimally invasive procedures or surgery. The treatment your doctor chooses will be based on how severe your atrial fibrillation is and other health conditions you may already have.<br /><a href='#collapse6'>Medicines</a><br />Medicines that may be used to treat atrial fibrillation include:<br />Blood-thinning medicines to prevent blood clots and stroke.<br />Rate control medicines to slow a rapid heartbeat.<br />Rhythm control medicines to help your heart beat with a normal pattern.<br /><a href='#collapse7'>Ablation and Cryoablation </a><br />Ablation is a treatment that burns or freezes small parts of the heart to create scar tissue. This scar tissue stops the abnormal electrical signals that cause atrial fibrillation.<br />The ablation procedure may use heat or cold to create the scar tissue. When cold temperatures are used, the procedure is called cryoablation.<br />During ablation, you will be mildly sedated. Your doctor will make a small incision (cut) in your groin and insert thin, flexible tubes (catheters) into a blood vessel and feed the tube up to your heart. The tube will have small electrodes on the tip.<br />Your doctor will place the catheters on different areas of the heart and send electrical pulses through the catheter. The catheter then records the heart’s signals to find out where the abnormal electrical signals are coming from.<br />Once your doctor finds where the abnormal signals are coming from, he or she will send heat or cold through the catheter tips. This forms scars on that area of the heart and stops the abnormal signals.<br /><a href='#collapse8'>AV node ablation</a><br />AV node ablation helps control your heart rate by using heat to form scar tissue on the part of the heart that connects the upper and lower chambers (AV node). This process stops the upper chambers of the heart from sending irregular electrical signals to the bottom chambers.<br /><a href='#collapse9'>Electrical cardioversion</a><br />During electrical cardioversion, your doctor will send a low-energy shock to your heart to reset it to a normal rhythm. This treatment is usually only temporary.<br /><a href='#collapse10'>Implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD)</a><br />An ICD is similar to a pacemaker. It’s a device that’s attached to the heart and sends low-energy shocks to your heart to reset it to a normal rhythm.<br /><a href='#collapse11'>Open-heart maze procedure</a><br />During an open-heart maze procedure, a surgeon makes several small cuts in the upper part of your heart and stitches the cuts together. This process creates scar tissue, which helps prevent the heart from sending electrical signals that cause atrial fibrillation. Your doctor may recommend this treatment if medicines and other less-invasive treatments do not work.<br /><a href='#collapse12'>Pacemaker</a><br />A pacemaker is a small device that your doctor inserts under the skin and attaches to the heart. It sends electrical signals to the heart to prevent slow heartbeats.<br /><a href='#collapse13'>Subcutaneous implantable cardioverter defibrillator (S-ICD)</a><br />An S-ICD is a small device that’s placed under the skin but isn’t attached directly to the heart. It sends low-energy shocks to your heart to reset it to a normal rhythm.<br />Schedule a visit with your primary care doctor to begin taking steps to lower your risk for AFib.<br />",

      "articleContent": "Understanding ADHD<br />Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common childhood developmental disorders.<br />Typically symptoms start developing before age 7. Children with ADHD may appear overly hyper, compulsive, active or unable to focus. These symptoms create significant challenges in at least two areas of their day-to-day life – home, social settings, school, activities or work (for adults).<br />Remember that everyone matures differently. Behaviors shouldn’t cause concern unless they are more severe or frequent than in other children the same age. Additional factors – personality, temperament, energy or other health conditions – are sometimes mistaken for ADHD. Because of this, careful diagnosis is crucial. The evaluation process typically includes several tests performed by a <a href='/find-locations/location-results?LocationText=behavioral%20health'>behavioral health</a> professional.<br />What are the common ADHD symptoms? Signs are grouped into three areas:<br />Inattention<br />Easily distracted<br />Does not appear to listen<br />Avoids or dislikes tasks requiring sustained mental effort<br />Struggles to follow through on instructions – especially multiple steps<br />Frequently forgets or misplaces belongings<br />Hyperactivity<br />Has difficulty doing quiet activities<br />Excessively fidgets or talks; squirmy<br />Has difficulty remaining seated<br />Acts as if driven by a motor<br />Impulsivity<br />Blurts out answers before questions have been completed<br />Frequently makes unnecessary mistakes or take risks<br />Interrupts others<br />Has difficulty waiting or taking turns<br />What should you do if your think your child has ADHD? Contact your pediatrician to discuss. If further assessment is needed, your pediatrician may recommend evaluation by a licensed behavioral health professional.<br />",

      "overview": "<a></a><br />Understanding Autism<br />Having answers always helps. We’re here with answers to your questions about what your child is experiencing. Autism, also known as autism spectrum disorder (ASD), is a developmental disability that causes major social, behavioral and communication problems. It’s a lifelong condition that affects one in 59 children in the United States.<br />ASD describes several different conditions that used to be diagnosed separately, including:<br />Autistic disorder.<br />Pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified (PDD-NOS).<br />Asperger’s syndrome.<br /><a href='#collapse1'>Signs of Autism</a><br />You may first notice signs of autism before your child turns three. But they most often appear within the first 12 to 18 months.<br />Remember, autism spectrum disorder affects everyone differently. Symptoms vary from child to child. The most important thing is to talk with your pediatrician about your concerns.<br />Communication problems are often the first signs of autism. A child with autism may not:<br />Babble or respond to his or her name by 10 months.<br />Be soothed by mom’s voice by three months.<br />Follow simple spoken directions.<br />Give big smiles by six months.<br />Imitate simple words or sounds by 15 months.<br />Locate objects when asked by 15 months.<br />Make eye contact.<br />Seem startled by loud sounds by three months.<br />Understand common words such as “no” or “bye-bye.”<br />Want to be with other people.<br />Along with having communication problems, a child with autism may:<br />Arch his or her back or make other unusual body movements.<br />Be extremely irritable.<br />Frequently choke or gag.<br />Have a floppy or limp body.<br />Have stiff arms or legs.<br />Make minimal gestures — such as pointing, reaching and waving — by 12 months.<br />Only use one side of the body.<br /><a href='#collapse2'>Risk Factors</a><br />Autism can affect children of all races, ethnic groups, education levels and incomes. It’s almost four times more likely to affect boys than girls.<br />There’s no known single cause of autism. Researchers are still looking into why some children develop autism and others don’t.<br />Risk factors for autism may include:<br />A sibling with autism.<br />Genetic conditions, such as Rett, fragile X or Down syndromes.<br />Low birth weight.<br />Older parents.<br />There’s no proven link between vaccines and autism.<br /><a href='#collapse3'>Diagnosis</a><br />Your child’s pediatrician will perform developmental tests during the first two years of check-ups. A doctor who thinks your child may have an autism spectrum disorder will suggest a diagnostic evaluation, which looks at your child’s behavior and development. This may include:<br />Genetic tests.<br />Hearing tests.<br />Neurological (nervous system) tests.<br />Medical tests, such as blood tests.<br />Vision tests.<br />In some cases, your child’s pediatrician may want you to go to a specialist who does the diagnostic evaluation. These specialists can include:<br />Child psychiatrist or psychologists.<br />Developmental pediatricians.<br />Occupational therapists.<br />Pediatric neurologists.<br />Speech and language therapists.<br /><a href='#collapse4'>Treatment</a><br />While there’s no single treatment or medicine that can cure autism, there’s hope and help. Behavioral and communication therapies have been shown to help improve the way a child functions in life, especially if therapy is used early.<br />At ProMedica, you’ll find in-depth applied behavioral analysis (ABA) services at the <a href='/location/promedica-ebeid-childrens-hospital-finnegan-family-autism-center'>Finnegan Family Autism Center</a> at ProMedica Russell J. Ebeid Children’s Hospital. That’s where our board-certified behavior analysts, special educators, speech and language pathologists and behavior therapists will focus on helping your child with:<br />Behavior.<br />Communication.<br />Life skills that fit your child’s developmental level.<br />Play and social skills.<br />Your child will also have a personalized treatment plan that includes:<br />Behavioral and educational consultation.<br />Behavioral therapy.<br />Functional behavior assessment.<br />Intensive applied behavior analysis intervention.<br />Ongoing evaluations.<br />Speech and language services.<br />Your child will start treatment with one-on-one sessions and then move into small group settings. Our specialists also encourage parents and family members to be involved with the treatment.<br />Your child’s pediatrician or specialist may also prescribe some medicines to help manage your child’s autism-related symptoms. These symptoms may include high energy levels, depression, seizures or inability to focus.<br />",

At ProMedica, we support your desire for a full, healthy life by equipping you with the knowledge and tools for long-term success. From seminars that explain your surgery options to support groups following your surgery, we’re here to help you every step of the way.<br /><a href='#collapse5'>Benefits of Weight Loss Surgery</a><br />Some benefits of weight loss surgery are clear. As in, people see a major improvement in their overall health and well-being. But weight loss surgery offers many other health benefits that can help you lead a longer, happier life.<br />Benefits of weight loss surgery include:<br />Better mood and self-esteem.<br />Enhanced fertility in younger women.<br />Less pain related to osteoarthritis.<br />Lowered risk of heart disease.<br />Much lower blood pressure and cholesterol levels.<br />Reduced risk of breast and colon cancer.<br />Relief from acid reflux and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD).<br />Resolved sleep apnea and respiratory issues.<br />Diabetes Management<br />Weight loss surgery can have major, life-changing effects, especially for those with type 2 diabetes. Weight loss can not only help prevent the onset of diabetes, but it can even reverse the condition. About 84% of patients report remission of their diabetes after surgery. Other people typically need less medicine to control their condition.<br />So how does bariatric surgery help diabetes? Weight loss surgery limits your food intake. The small intestine is rerouted slightly, which redirects the digestive process. The result is that your body absorbs fewer calories. This can balance the insulin-regulating hormones in the intestines and stomach that cause diabetes.<br />For some people, diabetes goes away within days of surgery. For others, blood sugar levels begin to fall soon after surgery and become completely normal within a year. Long-term benefits include a lower risk of stroke, kidney disease, blindness and peripheral nerve damage.<br /><a href='#collapse6'>Risks of Weight Loss Surgery</a><br />All surgeries come with risks. If you’re thinking about having weight loss surgery, be sure to talk with your doctor about these risks:<br />Blood clots.<br />Gallstones or gallbladder disease.<br />Hernias.<br />Infection.<br />Intestinal disorders.<br />Vitamin deficiencies.<br /><a href='#collapse7'>Types of Weight Loss Surgery</a><br />Single Anastomosis Duodenal-Ileal bypass with Sleeve (SADI-S)<br />The SADI-S procedure consists of a sleeve gastrectomy and a bypass of some of the small intestine with one connection between the duodenum and the small intestine. Endorsed by the American Society of Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery in 2019, the surgery works in three ways.<br />The sleeve gastrectomy portion of this surgery creates a 2-3 oz small stomach and as a result, a person cannot eat much.<br />Food will move from the new small stomach directly into the lower 10 feet of the small intestine and bypass the first part of the small intestine, which is about half of the small intestine. Normally, the small intestine that is available to absorb calories and nutrients is around 15 to 25 feet long. The result is that less of the calories are absorbed.<br />Additional Facts about the SADI-S:<br />The sleeve gastrectomy portion of this surgery creates a 2-3 oz small stomach and as a result, a person cannot eat much.<br />Food will move from the new small stomach directly into the lower 10 feet of the small intestine and bypass the first part of the small intestine, which is about half of the small intestine. Normally, the small intestine that is available to absorb calories and nutrients is around 15 to 25 feet long. The result is that less of the calories are absorbed.<br />Revision Surgery<br />Bariatric Revision Surgery is a procedure that corrects or improves prior weight loss surgery. Most of the time, bariatric surgery is successful. However, it may be recommended for you if you’ve experienced:<br />Inadequate Weight Loss<br />Weight re-gain<br />Ruptured or displaced gastric bands<br />Displaced gastric band ports<br />Disrupted staples<br />Enlarged gastric pouch<br />Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD)<br />Problems swallowing<br />Bariatric Revision Surgery Options<br />At ProMedica Weight Loss Surgery, we use the latest minimally invasive technology, including robotic assisted surgery, to perform bariatric revision surgery. We offer several revision procedures, including:<br />Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass Revision<br />The original gastric pouch created during surgery may become larger over time. This procedure involves the following:<br />Increase intestinal bypass<br />Decrease pouch and stomach size<br />Gastric Sleeve Resection<br />We can correct gastric sleeve surgery by:<br />Converting the gastric sleeve to a gastric bypass<br />Recreating the gastric sleeve<br />Changing the gastric sleeve to duodenal switch<br />When a patient undergoes a revision to his or her gastric bypass, we usually see a 65-75% excess body weight loss, which is 65-70 lbs. weight loss for every 100 pounds. If a patient has a small stomach pouch which cannot be revised, weight loss is usually 50-55 lbs. for every 100 lbs. of excess body weight.<br />Insurers all have different requirements, but they generally cover revisions to the sleeve or bypass to address weight regain, if you meet these criteria: If your BMI is greater than 40, or if you have a BMI of 35 along with a medical problem related to obesity<br /><a href='#collapse8'>What to Expect Before Surgery</a><br />The first step in our program is to see if weight loss surgery is the right choice for you. We want all of our patients to achieve lifelong health, which is why we’ll only recommend surgery if we believe you’re a good candidate.<br />We look at a variety of factors, including your:<br />Age: You must be between the ages of 18 and 67.<br />Lifestyle and health: You must stop smoking at least three months before your weight loss surgery and agree not to smoke after surgery. You should also commit to exercising and eating a healthy diet after surgery. These are essential to help keep the weight off for good.<br />Personality: You must be motivated to make a real change in your health. The ideal candidate for weight loss surgery is willing to face the physical, emotional and social changes that come with weight loss.<br />Weight: You must have a body mass index (BMI) of 40 or more (about 100 pounds or more over ideal body weight). Or have a BMI of 35 to 39.9 with serious medical conditions related to obesity that would improve with weight loss.<br /><a href='#collapse9'>What to Expect After Surgery</a><br />Part of the bariatric surgery journey is for you to commit to healthier lifestyle changes. These include your diet and eating habits. This will be one of the biggest changes you’ll need to make after surgery.<br />Our bariatric dietitians will help you understand the dietary and nutritional changes to expect in the days and weeks after your weight loss surgery. We’ll support you through every step and guide you through meal options, food choices and more.<br />Right after surgery, your digestive system will need to rest and heal for a couple of days. You’ll begin a liquid diet of light broths and beverages while you’re still in the hospital.<br />After a few days of the liquid diet, you’ll move to pureed foods like lean meats, beans, yogurt and egg whites. You’ll eat pureed foods for a few weeks when you go home.<br />Once your body is comfortable with pureed foods, you’ll begin eating soft, solid foods like ground meats, soft fruits and cooked vegetables. You’ll continue to get support and menu ideas from your dietitian and bariatric care team for two to three months.<br />Eventually, your doctor will transition you back to enjoying solid, healthy foods.<br />After surgery, your body doesn’t absorb nutrients the way it used to. That’s why it’s important to take nutritional supplements. Supplements help make sure you’re getting all the nutrients you need. You can get supplements specially made for weight-loss surgery patients at our pharmacy partner, Pharmacy Counter.<br />Ideas for Cooking at Home<br />Once you return to eating solid food, there are many well-balanced meal choices. These videos and our free downloadable cookbook introduce some of the easy, healthy meals you can include in your post-bariatric diet.<br /><a href='/assets/documents/medical-services/weight-loss/weight-loss-surgery-cookbook.pdf'>Download our free weight loss surgery cookbook. </a><br />Bariatric Breakfast<br /><a>  <img src='http://i3.ytimg.com/vi/xBnMc4L_7uk/maxresdefault.jpg' alt='Bariatric Breakfast' /></a><br />Make a well-balanced, perfectly portioned breakfast that’s high in protein and fiber.<br />Bariatric Lunch<br /><a>  <img src='http://i3.ytimg.com/vi/tZjT6gBDgBc/maxresdefault.jpg' alt='Bariatric Lunch' /></a><br />Check out how to use leftovers to create a healthy, pre-portioned lunch when you’re on the go.<br />Balanced Dinner<br /><a>  <img src='http://i3.ytimg.com/vi/SDcCpVgUkPE/maxresdefault.jpg' alt='Healthy Dinner' /></a><br />Discover this easy to make, high-protein recipe that everyone will love!<br /><a href='#collapse10'>Bariatric Support Group</a><br />On-going post-surgical support helps patients adjust to their new lifestyle and reach the greatest level of success.

      "articleContent": "<br />Understanding Bipolar Disorder<br />Bipolar disorder is a mental disorder that causes identifiable and sometimes intense changes in mood and energy level. Someone with bipolar disorder may experience periods of high energy (manic periods) followed by periods of depression or lethargy (depressive periods). The exact cause is unknown, but research suggests that it is hereditary, as it often runs in families. Studies are still underway to try and identify which gene (or genes) may be responsible.<br />Signs of Bipolar Disorder<br />Someone with bipolar disorder will experience both types of the following symptoms to a varying degree:<br />Manic symptoms:<br />Has an overly inflated sense of self-esteem<br />Seems to not need sleep or rest as much<br />Is very distracted and irritable<br />Excessively gets involved in high-risk and/or pleasurable activities, for example: sexual promiscuity, reckless driving, reckless spending, substance abuse<br />Enhanced talkativeness<br />Appears to have excessive “high” or euphoric feelings, grandiose at times<br />Unpredictably changes mood from happy or silly, anger or agitation<br />Increased sex drive<br />Increased energy level<br />Uses uncharacteristic poor judgment<br />Depressive symptoms:<br />Difficulty with relationships<br />Expresses excessive guilt<br />Expresses hopelessness<br />Is extremely sensitive to failure or rejection<br />Is unable to concentrate<br />Lacks energy<br />Lacks interest in activities once enjoyed<br />Persistently suffers sadness<br />Seems irritable, hostile or aggressive<br />Shares feelings of wanting to die<br />Shows changes in appetite or weight<br />Shows signs of low self-esteem<br />Sleeps too much or very little<br />Thinks about suicide or attempts suicide<br />If you think you may have bipolar disorder, talk to your primary care doctor. After ruling out other conditions through a physical exam, they can help you find a psychiatrist, psychologist or other behavioral health specialist with experience in treating bipolar disorder.<br />Bipolar Disorder in Children and Adolescents<br />Bipolar disorder is a condition with alternating sets of symptoms. During certain periods of time, your child or adolescent may act extremely happy, elated, or very irritable (manic symptoms). During the alternate periods of time they will exhibit symptoms of <a href='/services-and-conditions/depression'>major depression.</a><br />When symptoms are present before age 12, they are sometimes confused with <a href='/services-and-conditions/attention-defecit-hyperactivity-disorder-adhd'>attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)</a>. However, advances continue to be made in recognizing bipolar disorder in younger children.<br />If you believe your child has bipolar disorder, contact your pediatrician or family doctor to set up an appointment for evaluation. If further assessment is needed, your doctor may recommend evaluation by a licensed behavioral health professional. Bipolar disorder can be effectively treated, usually with a combination of therapy and medication.<br />",

You want to take it a step further and make a difference in the lives of others affected by cancer and disease. What about contributing to medical research advancement at the ProMedica BioRepository?<br />It’s so simple to donate your blood and body tissue samples.<br />Biorepository FAQs<br /><a href='#faq1'>What is the ProMedica BioRepository?</a><br />It’s a “bank” that stores tissue or blood samples, called biospecimens, that can be used to help researchers discover new treatments for cancer and other medical conditions. The ProMedica BioRepository is located on the <a href='/location/promedica-toledo-hospital'>ProMedica Toledo Hospital</a> campus and it’s your local answer to helping others and furthering medicine.<br /><a href='#faq2'>What do the researchers do with tissue and blood samples?</a><br />An ultra low-temperature laboratory freezer preserves your samples for long term storage. The research on these samples can be used to discover what causes <a href='/services-and-conditions/cancer/'>cancer</a>, how to prevent it, and how to treat it. It can also help us learn the causes of and find treatments for other diseases such as:<br /><a href='/services-and-conditions/diabetes'>Diabetes</a><br /><a href='/services-and-conditions/neurosciences/'>Alzheimer's Disease</a><br /><a href='/services-and-conditions/heart-disease'>Heart disease</a><br />Crohn's Disease<br /><a href='#faq3'>Where do tissue and blood samples come from?</a><br />You have the ability to easily donate your tissues and blood samples if you’re undergoing a procedure. At your scheduled pre-op appointment, you may request the blood samples taken during your procedure be donated to our ProMedica BioRepository. As for tissue donation, your doctor removes a certain amount of tissue needed for your diagnosis or treatment during your procedure. But sometimes, there’s extra tissue. In most situations, this tissue is destroyed. Instead of destroying what’s left over, you may choose to have it donated to the ProMedica BioRepository.<br /><a href='#faq4'>Will donating affect diagnostic results?</a><br />No, your leftover tissue donation will not affect your diagnostic results.<br /><a href='#faq5'>How much blood do you need to donate?</a><br />For blood samples, you’ll be asked for permission for an additional four to six teaspoons to store in the BioRepository. It’s done at the same time as your scheduled blood workup, so no separate appointment is needed.<br /><a href='#faq6'>Can you be identified from your donation?</a><br />No. Identification of all donated samples is replaced with a code, which allows for de-identified tissue donation.<br /><a href='#faq7'>Is it safe?</a><br />Yes. You don’t need to go through any extra procedures or tests. The remaining tissue leftover from your procedure is all that’s needed.<br /><a href='#faq8'>How do you do it?</a><br />If you’re interested, please speak with your doctor. When you come in for pre-admission testing or for a procedure, a ProMedica BioRepository member may speak with you and give you the choice to participate. For further information, please call <a target='_blank' href='tel:+14192914584'>419-291-4584</a>.<br /><a href='/assets/documents/medical-services/labs/pro-biorepository.pdf' target='_blank'>Learn more about the Biorepository</a>.<br />",

Some are formed inside the brain (glioma). Other tumors start as cancer somewhere else in the body and then land in the brain (metastatic). There are also tumors that grow on the outside surface of the brain and create pressure (meningioma). Every type of brain tumor has many levels of severity and there are different treatments for each type.<br />It’s important to know the risks for developing a brain tumor, especially if you have a family history. Many times, these symptoms may appear: new or changing headaches, seizures, hearing or vision loss, fatigue and cognitive issues. But the type, size and location of a tumor can also dictate the kinds of symptoms you have. If you have any concerns, please talk about them with your family doctor.<br />",

During your visit, your family doctor may perform a standard neurological exam to test your nervous system.<br />If your doctor has a concern, a CT scan or MRI of your brain will likely be the next step.<br />If a brain tumor is found during diagnostic testing, you will then be referred to a neurosurgeon or oncologist for more specific testing.<br />A neurosurgeon can perform a biopsy to analyze the tumor. During the biopsy, a sample of the tumor tissue is removed and then sent to a pathologist.

The clinic provides patients with access to both a cerebrovascular neurosurgeon and an interventional vascular neurologist during the same clinic encounter. That means patients and their families can talk with both doctors about the jointly developed plan to manage the patient’s brain aneurysm. We offer a wide-range of treatment options including surgical clipping, endovascular coiling, flow diversion and observation with follow-up imaging.<br />Surgical Treatments<br />It’s our goal to treat you with minimally invasive methods whenever we can. They include medicines and minimally invasive therapies. But sometimes surgery is needed. Your specialist may advise surgery if the aneurysm is in danger of rupturing. There are three primary surgical treatments for a brain aneurysm:<br />Endovascular coiling: Also called coil embolization, endovascular coiling is a minimally invasive method. This means an incision (cut) in the skull is not needed to treat the cerebral aneurysm.<br />Open craniotomy (surgical clipping): This procedure uses surgery to remove part of the skull.<br />Woven Endobridge (WEB) Aneurysm Embolization System: Called The Web, this device is used for treating complex brain aneurysms. In 2019, ProMedica became the first regional center in northern Ohio and Michigan to offer a this new, cutting-edge treatment for brain aneurysms. The device offers patients with complex brain aneurysms a treatment that is less risky and less difficult than previous endovascular therapy.<br />",

However, if any of the following risk factors also apply to you, your doctor may recommend that you have mammograms earlier or more often:<br />Increased age.<br />Obesity.<br />Personal or a family history of breast cancer.<br />Prior radiation treatment to the chest.<br />Tobacco or alcohol use, or both.<br /><a href='#collapse2'>Breast Cancer Signs</a><br />Often, the first sign of breast cancer is a lump or a change in the feel of the breast. But there are other symptoms that may alert your doctor to possible breast cancer and the need for a mammogram. These include:<br />Changes in the nipple.<br />Itchy or irritated breast.<br />Nipple discharge.<br />Pain in the breast.<br />Redness or color changes in the breast.<br />Swelling of the breast.<br />Detecting cancer early can increase your chances for recovery and may even save your life. Speak with your doctor right away if you notice any unusual changes in your breasts.<br /><a href='#collapse3'>Breast Exams</a><br />There are three levels of breast cancer detection. These include breast self-exams, clinical breast exams and mammograms. Your doctor will recommend the exams that are right for you, based on your age and risk factors.<br />Breast Self-Exams<br />A breast self-exam is a check-up you can do at home to look for changes or problems in the breast tissue. Your doctor may recommend that you include a monthly self-exam as part of your wellness routine. If so, your doctor will give you instructions on how to do a breast self-exam.<br />Clinical Breast Exams<br />Starting in your 20s and 30s, your doctor will include a clinical breast exam as part of your regular well-woman visit. The exam will be done at least every three years.<br />Mammograms<br /><a href='/services-and-conditions/mammography'>Mammograms</a> can find a change in your breasts before you can feel it. That’s why ProMedica recommends that you receive a baseline mammogram at 35 years old (25 years old if your mother had breast cancer before the age of 35), then annually beginning at 40 years old.<br /><a href='#collapse4'>How to Schedule Your Mammogram</a><br />We believe it shouldn’t be hard for you to schedule preventive and diagnostic testing. That’s why we offer just one number to call to schedule a mammogram at any of our convenient locations throughout northwest Ohio and southeast Michigan. Our schedulers can help you find a convenient time and location. All you have to do is:<br />Receive an order from your doctor. If your doctor is a ProMedica Physician, you can find this order in your <a href='https://mychart.promedica.org/MyChart/'>MyChart account.</a><br />Call ProMedica Central Scheduling at <a href='tel:419-291-3000'>419-291-3000</a> or <a href='tel:1-800-479-8805'>1-800-479-8805</a> to schedule. Or, <a href='https://mychart.promedica.org/MyChart/'>login to your MyChart account</a> to schedule your mammogram.<br /><a href='/find-locations/location-results?LocationTypeId=66'>Find a mammogram location near you.</a><br /><a href='#collapse5'>Diagnosis</a><br />If a mammogram finds something suspicious in your breast, the next step is diagnostic testing. At ProMedica Breast Care and our locations across the ProMedica system, we offer specialized diagnostic tests. They’re given by caring experts in breast cancer and women’s health.<br />Based on your unique condition and screening results, the needed diagnostic tests may include:<br />Breast tomosynthesis.<br />Breast ultrasound.<br /><a href='/services-and-conditions/breast-mri'>Dedicated breast MRI scanning</a>.<br /><a href='/services-and-conditions/mammography'>Digital mammograms</a>.<br />Image-guided breast biopsies (ultrasound, MRI or stereotactic).<br />Magnetic seed localization.<br /><a href='/services-and-conditions/molecular-breast-imaging'>Molecular breast imaging scanning</a>.<br />Breasts have many layers of glandular and fatty tissue. Because of that, sometimes we need to combine several tests to get a complete picture of your breast health.<br />The screening process can seem confusing and cause anxiety for many women. We strive to guide you through the screening process as quickly and easily as possible. If your exam is diagnostic, we may offer an ultrasound or biopsy that same day if needed to speed up the process of getting a diagnosis. MRIs and MBIs will likely be scheduled out as they must coincide with your menstrual cycle. Here are the screening steps you might expect when you come to ProMedica for breast care:<br />Clinical breast exam.<br />Mammogram to detect abnormalities in breast tissue.<br />Ultrasound to learn if the mass is a cyst or tumor.<br /><a href='/services-and-conditions/breast-biopsy'>Biopsy</a> for lab evaluation.<br />Another mammogram to confirm the biopsy was in the right place.<br /><a href='/services-and-conditions/breast-mri'>MRI</a> or <a href='/services-and-conditions/molecular-breast-imaging'>MBI</a> if the biopsy is positive for cancer.<br />Breast cancer treatment begins.<br />",

While these changes usually don’t last, it’s possible some will be long-term. It may be helpful to know that, as difficult as they are, some changes are common in people going through cancer treatment and recovery. If you need support as you deal with these changes, never be afraid to ask for help.<br /><a href='#innerTab'>Physical Changes</a><br /><a href='#innerTab'>Cognitive and Emotional Changes</a><br /><a href='#innerTab'>Dietary Changes</a><br />Physical Changes<br />It’s common to go through some physical changes during cancer treatment. But it’s important to keep in mind that every person’s body responds to treatment in its own way. It’s common for cancer patients to go through these changes:<br />Bowel and bladder problems.<br />Burning, numbness or tingling in your hands and feet.<br />Having less strength and endurance.<br />Trouble swallowing.<br />Fatigue.<br />Hair loss.<br />Menopause symptoms.<br />Mouth sores and teeth problems.<br />Pain.<br />Surgery scars.<br />Swelling.<br /><br /><br />Some changes in your body may mean there are other health problems. Your treatment plan may need to be adjusted. Always talk with your doctor if you have any of these changes:<br />Confusion, dizziness or loss of balance.<br />Trouble breathing.<br />Extreme tiredness that gets worse.<br />Persistent constipation.<br />Trouble waking up.<br />Nausea, vomiting or diarrhea that can’t be controlled.<br />Cognitive and Emotional Changes<br />Cancer treatment can affect the way you feel and think. As your body changes, the way you see and think about yourself can also change. This is normal and you shouldn’t feel afraid or ashamed to share what you’re dealing with.<br />Mental and emotional changes may include:<br />Anger.<br />Anxiety.<br />Trouble concentrating.<br />Depression.<br />Fear.<br />Memory loss.<br />Dietary Changes<br />Many people have changes in their appetite as they go through cancer treatment. Because of certain medicines, you may not feel hungry. However, it’s very important to eat nutritious, balanced meals. A healthy diet can help you stay strong. Certain foods can even help you manage some side effects of cancer treatment such as nausea and fatigue.<br />Talk to your doctor if you’re concerned about your diet or appetite. Your doctor can make meal suggestions or connect you with a dietitian who can address specific concerns.<br />You may want to keep a daily record of what you eat and drink. Note the type of food you eat, how much you eat and what time you eat. This can help your doctor learn if you’re getting the right nutrients and enough calories.<br />Other tips for your diet include:<br />Eating frequently: Even if you have less appetite, it’s important to eat regularly. If you’re losing weight, eat a small meal or snack every few hours. This will help you keep your weight up and get the nutrition you need.<br />Eating protein and healthy fats: These nutrients give you long-lasting energy. Protein also helps your body repair and heal itself. Protein and healthy fats can be found in seeds, salmon, chicken breast, hamburger, tofu, tempeh, lentils, milk, nuts, nut butters and eggs.<br />Staying hydrated: Drink plenty of fluids. Dehydration adds to fatigue, so drink water, unsweetened tea, 100% fruit juice or sports drinks. Avoid soda and sugary drinks.<br /><a href='#collapse1'>Physical Changes</a><br />Physical Changes<br />It’s common to go through some physical changes during cancer treatment.

It’s common for cancer patients to go through these changes:<br />Bowel and bladder problems.<br />Burning, numbness or tingling in your hands and feet.<br />Having less strength and endurance.<br />Trouble swallowing.<br />Fatigue.<br />Hair loss.<br />Menopause symptoms.<br />Mouth sores and teeth problems.<br />Pain.<br />Surgery scars.<br />Swelling.<br /><br /><br />Some changes in your body may mean there are other health problems. Your treatment plan may need to be adjusted. Always talk with your doctor if you have any of these changes:<br />Confusion, dizziness or loss of balance.<br />Trouble breathing.<br />Extreme tiredness that gets worse.<br />Persistent constipation.<br />Trouble waking up.<br />Nausea, vomiting or diarrhea that can’t be controlled.<br /><a href='#collapse2'>Cognitive and Emotional Changes</a><br />Cognitive and Emotional Changes<br />Cancer treatment can affect the way you feel and think. As your body changes, the way you see and think about yourself can also change. This is normal and you shouldn’t feel afraid or ashamed to share what you’re dealing with.<br />Mental and emotional changes may include:<br />Anger.<br />Anxiety.<br />Trouble concentrating.<br />Depression.<br />Fear.<br />Memory loss.<br /><a href='#collapse3'>Dietary Changes</a><br />Dietary Changes<br />Many people have changes in their appetite as they go through cancer treatment. Because of certain medicines, you may not feel hungry. However, it’s very important to eat nutritious, balanced meals. A healthy diet can help you stay strong. Certain foods can even help you manage some side effects of cancer treatment such as nausea and fatigue.<br />Talk to your doctor if you’re concerned about your diet or appetite. Your doctor can make meal suggestions or connect you with a dietitian who can address specific concerns.<br />You may want to keep a daily record of what you eat and drink. Note the type of food you eat, how much you eat and what time you eat. This can help your doctor learn if you’re getting the right nutrients and enough calories.<br />Other tips for your diet include:<br />Eating frequently: Even if you have less appetite, it’s important to eat regularly. If you’re losing weight, eat a small meal or snack every few hours. This will help you keep your weight up and get the nutrition you need.<br />Eating protein and healthy fats: These nutrients give you long-lasting energy. Protein also helps your body repair and heal itself. Protein and healthy fats can be found in seeds, salmon, chicken breast, hamburger, tofu, tempeh, lentils, milk, nuts, nut butters and eggs.<br />Staying hydrated: Drink plenty of fluids. Dehydration adds to fatigue, so drink water, unsweetened tea, 100% fruit juice or sports drinks. Avoid soda and sugary drinks.<br />",

A nurse practitioner and an oncologist will review your health and treatment history.<br />Make sure to let your nurse and doctor know if you’re having any new symptoms or having trouble doing your daily activities. You can also use this time to ask questions about the long-term effects of treatment, such as sleep problems or intimacy issues.<br />During this first visit, we may do a physical exam or order tests to check if the cancer may be coming back. We can perform risk assessments to learn if you’re at risk for other cancers. We’ll also suggest healthy lifestyle changes.<br />From here, we’ll come up with your follow-up medical plan and share it with your primary doctor. You will also receive a Cancer Treatment Summary and Survivorship Care Plan.

Sometimes the normal cells in and around your heart may also be harmed, causing lasting damage. This is called cardio toxicity. Your risk increases if you already have <a href='/services-and-conditions/heart-disease'>heart disease</a>.<br />The cardio-oncology program at <a href='/services-and-conditions/cancer/cancer-institute'>ProMedica Cancer Institute</a> balances these risks. Our team of cardiologists and hematologists/oncologists work with you and your primary care provider to lessen the cardio toxicity that may be caused by your cancer treatment.<br />Cardio-oncology is appropriate at any stage of your cancer treatment or <a href='/services-and-conditions/cancer-survivorship'>survivorship journey</a>.

Call your surgeon’s office if you have any concerns about day-of instructions.<br />If you begin to experience chest pain, shortness of breath, flu-like symptoms, rash or fever, call your surgeon’s office immediately.<br />What to Expect After Heart Surgery<br />Cardiothoracic surgery is complex, so your procedure could take anywhere from three to five hours. Your care team will provide updates to your family throughout your surgery and into recovery.<br />After surgery, your family members and loved ones will be able to visit you in the intensive care unit (ICU). Once recovery milestones have been met, you will be transferred from the ICU to a step-down unit.<br />As you continue to recover in the hospital, your care team will help you:<br />Eat more.<br />Manage pain.<br />Move more.<br />You should be ready to go home from the hospital three to five days after surgery. A discharge planner from the hospital will meet with you to discuss your needs for home health care and details on your cardiac rehab program.<br />",

      "articleContent": "<br />About Carotid Artery Disease<br />Carotid artery disease, also called carotid artery stenosis, is a common cause for <a href='/services-and-conditions/stroke'>stroke</a>. You want to understand more about this vascular disease and the risks for yourself, or for someone you care for.<br />The carotid arteries are the main blood vessels, one on each side of your neck, that carry blood up to your brain. If you’re diagnosed with this disease, it means a fatty deposit (plaque) has built up in one or both of the carotid arteries and this plaque is restricting blood flow to your brain. Pieces of this plaque can break off and briefly block the artery, causing a transient ischemic attack (TIA) or “mini stroke,” or break off and completely block the artery, causing a stroke.<br />",

General screening recommendations from the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists are as follows:<br />Under 21 years: no screening.<br />21 – 29 years old: Pap test every 3 years.<br />30 – 65 years old: combined Pap test and HPV test every 5 years OR Pap test every 3 years OR HPV test every 5 years.<br />Screening recommendations depend on your age and health history. Your healthcare provider can help you choose the best exam schedule for you. The doctor can also recommend any added testing or screening for you, based on your unique history and needs. Talk with your doctor about scheduling a screening.<br />Your recommended screenings may include:<br />Pelvic exams: Typically, a pelvic exam is the first step in diagnosing gynecologic cancers. During a pelvic exam, your doctor will be able to note changes in the size or shape of your cervix.<br />Pap tests: Cell changes on the cervix called precancers can become cervical cancer if they aren’t treated. A Pap test, also sometimes called a Pap smear, can help your doctor test for these cell changes.<br /> Colposcopy: If the results of your Pap test are abnormal, your doctor will recommend a procedure called a colposcopy. This lets your doctor examine the surface of your cervix to find any abnormal areas.<br />Biopsy: If an abnormal area is seen during a colposcopy, a biopsy will be done to learn if it’s cancer.<br />HPV tests: These tests let you know whether or not you have HPV, which can produce cancerous cells. It’s a good first step if you’re having symptoms.<br /><a href='https://promedicahealthconnect.org/general-health/4-things-you-may-not-know-about-cervical-cancer-screenings/'>Learn more about cervical cancer screening. </a><br /><a href='#collapse6'>Find Expert Cervical Cancer Treatment</a><br />It can feel overwhelming to be diagnosed with cervical cancer and have to navigate your treatment choices.

      "articleContent": "<br />Understanding Chemotherapy<br />Your doctor has recommended chemotherapy and you want to know what this means for you. What is chemotherapy? It’s the use of medications to treat cancer. Depending on the cancer type and its stage, chemotherapy is used to treat cancer, keep it from spreading, slow its cell growth, or to relieve its symptoms.<br />Chemotherapy, commonly referred to as chemo, destroys cancer cells and stops them from growing or multiplying. Chemotherapy can be used along with radiation therapy, surgery, or both.<br /><a href='#faq1'>How is chemotherapy given?</a><br />You may be treated in your doctor’s office, a clinic in the hospital, or at home. Some common methods include:<br />Intravenous (through your veins)<br />Oral (by mouth)<br />Intramuscular (injected deep into the muscle)<br />Intrathecal (injected into the spinal canal)<br />Sometimes, a more permanent catheter type is recommended to avoid repeated painful needle sticks into your vein. These permanent catheters are called “central venous catheters” and are placed under your skin’s surface. Chemotherapy, blood, and IV fluids can be given through this catheter, and blood for lab tests can be drawn from this site.<br />An implantable port can also be used to deliver chemotherapy. It’s round in shape and is usually surgically inserted under your skin surface on the chest wall between your neck and shoulder. To use the port, the nurse will insert a needle through your skin surface to access it.<br /><a href='#faq2'>How long does chemotherapy treatment last?</a><br />Your dosage schedule is individualized to your treatment plan. This may last a few weeks, up to a year, or longer with varying cycle frequency. Treatments can be once a week, once a month, or other intervals. Treatments are followed by rest cycles to give your body time to build healthy new cells and regain strength.<br /><a href='#faq6'>What are the side effects of chemotherapy?</a><br />Common side effects may include:<br />Fatigue<br />Infections<br />Nausea and vomiting<br />Hair loss<br />Anxiety, fear, anger, and depression due to life stress and chemotherapy’s effects on your mood<br />Mouth and throat sores<br />Anemia<br />Your potential side effects will depend on your drugs and dosages used to treat your cancer. Your doctor will prepare you for these side effects and recommend ways to cope and manage them including:<br />Nutrition for managing fatigue and nausea<br />Emotional support<br />Opportunities to discuss your unique experience and explore complimentary therapies<br />Resources for and information about hair loss<br />Infection control and education<br />",

There are also major differences between the causes, diagnoses and treatments for childhood cancers and those for adult cancers.<br />One of the biggest differences between childhood cancer and adult cancer is the survival rate. Childhood cancers usually have better outcomes. Doctors believe this is because childhood cancers respond better to treatment. Children can also tolerate more aggressive therapy.<br />Survival rates for childhood cancer depend on the child’s age, diagnosis and cancer type.<br /><a href='#collapse4'>Types of Childhood Cancer</a><br />Brain and Spinal Cord Tumors<br />There are many different kinds of brain and spinal cord tumors. Brain tumors tend to be more common than spine tumors.<br />Childhood brain tumors usually start in the lower part of the brain.<br />Brain and spine tumor symptoms may include:<br />Blurred or double vision.<br />Clumsiness.<br />Dizziness.<br />Nausea and vomiting.<br />Stumbling or falling.<br />Leukemia<br />Leukemia is a blood and bone marrow cancer. It’s the most common type of childhood cancer.<br />Leukemia symptoms may include:<br />Bleeding or bruising.<br />Bone and joint pain.<br />Fatigue.<br />Fever.<br />Pale skin.<br />Weakness.<br />Weight loss.<br />Lymphoma<br />Lymphoma starts in immune system cells. These cells are called lymphocytes. Lymphomas usually grow in the lymph nodes or parts of the lymph system, such as the tonsils or thymus gland.<br />Lymphoma can sometimes travel to the bone marrow or other organs. This is because the lymph system carries fluid all through the body.<br />There are two types of childhood lymphoma. The type depends on which kind of lymphocyte is affected by the cancer.

      "articleContent": "<br />Understanding Chromosomal Abnormalities<br />Chromosomal abnormalities onset as soon as a baby starts developing in the mother’s womb. Chromosomes (small “groups” of genes) in the body determine how a baby grows and functions after birth. Minor changes in these genes can greatly affect body and brain development.<br />Down Syndrome<br />Down syndrome affects about 1 out of every 700 babies born. The condition occurs when a baby develops in the womb with one extra copy of chromosome 21.<br />Down syndrome is normally tested for during pregnancy, or right after birth, to allow parents time to prepare for a baby requiring special needs.<br />While people with Down syndrome share similar physical traits, each individual has different abilities. They typically experience intellectual and physical challenges, but can reach full and productive lives with the support of speech, occupational and physical therapy.<br />Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS)<br />FAS can occur when a pregnant mother drinks alcohol, passing it through the umbilical cord to their baby.<br />Alcohol exposure can prevent a baby from developing properly in the womb. There is no measure for a “safe” amount of alcohol to drink during pregnancy. Zero consumption is recommended.<br />Children born with FAS may have abnormal facial features, experience stunted growth and central nervous system problems. In addition, many people experience trouble with learning, speech, sight, and hearing throughout their lives.<br />There is no cure for FAS, but early treatment and ongoing support can help a child reach their full potential.<br />Treatment factors:<br />Early diagnosis (before age 6)<br />Stable home environment<br />Absence of violence<br />Special education and social services<br />Our multidisciplinary team of physicians and behavioral health specialists can help your child reach their individual potential.<br />",

      "risks": "<a></a><br />Understand the Risks, Symptoms and Screening Guidelines<br />Colon cancer, often called colorectal cancer, is a cancer of your lower digestive tract (colon and rectum). Most colorectal cancers start as small bumps, called polyps, in the lining of your colon or rectum.<br />Some polyps can turn into cancer. Colorectal cancer is the third most common cancer diagnosed in both men and women in the United States. There are about 100,000 new cases of colon cancer and 40,000 new cases of rectal cancer each year.<br />Like other cancers, colorectal cancer can spread (metastasize) to other parts of the body. The <a href='/services-and-conditions/liver-cancer'>liver</a> and <a href='/services-and-conditions/lung-cancer'>lungs</a> are the most common places for colorectal cancer to spread.<br /><a href='#collapse5'>Know Your Risk</a><br />Since colorectal cancer often doesn’t show itself until its later stages, it’s crucial to understand your risks. When you’re aware of your risk factors, your doctor can help you plan a screening schedule that makes sense to you.<br />Colon cancer risk factors include:<br />Age: Colorectal cancer is more likely in men and women over the age of 50.<br />Genetics: A family history of colorectal cancer or adenomatous polyps (non-cancerous growths) raises your risk of colorectal cancer. Your risk also goes up if you have inherited syndromes such as Lynch syndrome (hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer, or HNPCC).<br />Health history: Colorectal cancer is more likely if you have colorectal polyps, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease or type 2 diabetes.<br />Race and ethnicity: African Americans have the highest colorectal cancer rates of all racial groups in the U.S. Jews of Eastern European descent (Ashkenazi Jews) have one of the highest colorectal cancer risks of any ethnic group in the world.<br />While there are some risk factors you can’t control, there are others you can manage by choosing to make changes. These include:<br />Body weight: Being overweight or obese raises your risk of developing colon or rectal cancer.<br />Diet: Eating a diet high in red meats and processed meats (like hot dogs and some luncheon meats) can raise your risk of colorectal cancer. Cooking meats at very high temperatures (frying, broiling, grilling) may raise your risk of cancer overall.<br />Lifestyle: Smoking, using tobacco and consuming large amounts of alcohol can raise your risk of colorectal cancer — and many other cancers, too.<br /><a href='#collapse6'>Recognize the Symptoms</a><br />For many, the symptoms of colon cancer can be very hard to detect, until it’s progressed to a later stage. That’s why it’s important to stay aware and talk with your doctor if you have:<br />Blood in your stool.<br />Changes in your bowel habits.<br />Cramping or abdominal (belly) pain.<br />Diarrhea or constipation lasting more than a few days.<br />Low red blood cell count.<br />Rectal bleeding.<br />Weakness and fatigue.<br />Unexplained weight loss.<br /><a href='#collapse7'>Protect Your Colon Health with Regular Screenings</a><br />Men and women age 45 and older should have a colonoscopy every 10 years. However, if you’re at greater risk for colorectal cancer, talk to your doctor about screening earlier and more often.<br />A colonoscopy is the most common way to diagnose colon cancer. It involves a visual exam of your colon, using a tiny, lighted camera. If polyps are found during your screening, your doctor can remove them right away.<br />ProMedica's <a href='/services-and-conditions/endoscopy/open-access-colonoscopy-program'>open access colonoscopy program</a> allows healthy people, age 50 and older and with an average risk for colon cancer, to schedule a colonoscopy without having an office visit first. Colonoscopies also offer an important advantage.<br /><a href='/services-and-conditions/endoscopy'>Learn more about our open access colonoscopy program.</a><br />Other screenings are also available. These tests let you take a stool sample at home to send to the lab. Along with being more private, they are also less invasive. While they serve a purpose and can be helpful, especially between colonoscopies, these tests aren’t as accurate as colonoscopies.<br />If a colonoscopy shows that you have colon cancer, your doctor may recommend more tests to learn the extent or stage of your cancer. Imaging exams can show the size of the tumor(s), how far into the lining of the colon and rectum the cancer has spread and if the cancer has spread to other parts of the body.<br />",

That’s why we’ll design a customized colorectal cancer treatment plan with your unique condition and needs in mind. Your doctor may even suggest combining treatments to help make sure you have the best possible outcome.<br /><a href='#collapse8'>Chemotherapy</a><br /><a href='/services-and-conditions/chemotherapy'>Chemotherapy</a> is a cancer treatment given intravenously (through a vein) to stop cancer cells from growing.<br />Hyperthermic Intraperitoneal Chemotherapy (HIPEC)<br />ProMedica offers a unique form of chemotherapy for colorectal cancer called hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC). Also called “hot chemotherapy,” we give this treatment during the surgery, immediately following the removal of the visible tumor(s) in the colon or rectum. The abdominal cavity is filled with a heated chemotherapy drug to kill any remaining microscopic cancer cells.<br />ProMedica Toledo Hospital, part of <a href='/services-and-conditions/cancer/cancer-institute'>ProMedica Cancer Institute</a>, is the only local hospital that offers this innovative therapy from the area’s only fellow-ship trained surgical oncologist, <a href='/find-a-doctor/provider-details?ProviderId=2054'>Jeffrey Sutton, MD</a>.<br />The benefits of HIPEC include:<br />Drug is contained to your abdominal cavity.<br />Given in a single treatment, not multiple visits.<br />More targeted, intense dose of chemotherapy.<br />Fewer side effects than traditional chemotherapy.<br />May be effective in killing the small, undetectable cancer cells that cannot be seen, which prevents them from forming into new tumors.<br /><a href='/services-and-conditions/hyperthermic-intraperitoneal-chemotherapy-hipec-treatment'>Learn more about HIPEC cancer treatment</a><br /><a href='#collapse9'>Radiation Therapy</a><br /><a href='/services-and-conditions/radiation-therapy'>Radiation therapy</a> uses high-energy X-rays to shrink and kill cancer cells. It's usually given after surgery or chemotherapy to lower the risk of the cancer coming back.<br /><a href='#collapse10'>Surgery</a><br />Surgery for colorectal cancer will depend on many factors, including how advanced the cancer is. If the cancer is in a very early stage, small or medium-sized polyps can even be removed during a colonoscopy (polypectomy).<br />Your doctor may perform an endoscopic mucosal resection during your colonoscopy, which removes the polyps as well as a layer of the colon’s lining.<br />Laparoscopic Colorectal Surgery<br />Polyps that can't be removed during a colonoscopy may be removed using laparoscopic surgery. In this minimally invasive procedure, your surgeon makes several small incisions (cuts) in your abdominal wall. The surgeon inserts a laparoscope (small, lighted video camera) through an incision to display your colon on a video monitor. Using this method, tumors can be removed without large incisions or too much soft tissue damage.<br />In some cases, your doctor may recommend a laparoscopic partial colectomy (partial removal of the colon). The cancerous sections of the colon are removed and the healthy portions are reattached.<br />Colostomy<br />If colorectal cancer is advanced, the surgeon may not be able to reattach sections of the colon after a colectomy. A colostomy may be needed, which is a procedure that makes an opening in the abdominal wall. Waste (stool) that would normally move through the colon is rerouted to exit the body into a bag on the outside of the body. A colostomy may be temporary or permanent.<br />At ProMedica, we know that having a colostomy has a huge impact on your daily life. That’s why we make every effort to treat your colorectal cancer conservatively or minimally invasively before recommending a colostomy.<br />",

      "articleContent": "Advanced Care for Cystic Fibrosis<br />Cystic fibrosis is a disease that primarily affects the lungs and pancreas, but impacts the entire body. While no cure currently exists, tremendous treatment developments now allow you or your loved one to live well into adulthood. Here you’ll find the care you need, at any age, from diagnosis to ongoing treatment and research.<br />Frequently Asked Questions<br /><a href='#faq1'>What is cystic fibrosis?</a><br />Cystic fibrosis is a genetic disease where the body creates an unusually thick, sticky mucus. The abnormal mucus clogs the lungs, causing infections and making it difficult to breathe. This mucous also prevents the pancreas from secreting the digestive enzymes produced. Without these enzymes, it’s hard for the body to absorb enough nutrients. Physical growth can be affected.<br />Symptoms include:<br />Salty tasting skin<br />Persistent cough, sometimes with phlegm<br />Frequent lung infections<br />Shortness of breath or wheezing<br />Slow growth and weight gain, in spite of eating well<br />Frequent bowel movements that may be greasy and bulky<br />Talk to your primary care physician right away if you or your child has any of these symptoms. Early treatment can help reduce the impact of this disease.<br /><a href='#faq2'>How is cystic fibrosis diagnosed?</a><br />Children are typically diagnosed before two years of age. Diagnosis occurs in several ways:<br />Newborn infant screening at birth (all children born in the U.S. are screened)<br /><a href='/assets/documents/medical-services/labs/cf_sweat_testing.pdf'>Sweat chloride test</a><br />Genetic testing<br />Chest X-rays and lung function testing<br />Stool sample analysis<br /><a href='/assets/documents/medical-services/labs/cf_sweat_testing.pdf'>Learn about sweat chloride testing </a><br /><a href='#faq3'>How is cystic fibrosis treated?</a><br />Cystic fibrosis treatment eases your, or your child’s, symptoms and improves quality of life. This disease affects individuals differently, so the treatment plan is tailored to you or your child.<br />Common treatments include:<br />Airway Clearing Techniques help you clear the thick mucus from your lungs.<br />Inhaled medicines (bronchodilators or antibiotics) are turned into a mist and inhaled.<br />Pancreatic enzymes capsules are taken before meals and snacks to aid with digestion.<br />Treating Cystic Fibrosis in Adults<br />Cystic Fibrosis is potentially life-threatening. But recent progress in treatments has more than doubled the life expectancy for those living with cystic fibrosis. Our treatments are state-of-the-art and based on the latest research and standards. You’ll get the expert care you need to keep going strong.<br />The Cystic Fibrosis Center of Northwest Ohio<br />Receive the latest, most advanced care at our nationally accredited <a href='/location/cystic-fibrosis-center-of-northwest-ohio'>Cystic Fibrosis Center of Northwest Ohio</a>.

Feel confident understanding what to expect and how it works.<br />What is a bone scan?<br />It’s an important way to see if a disease has developed in your bones. It functions much like a standard <a href='/services-and-conditions/x-ray'>X-ray</a>, but differs in that a radioactive material is injected into your body. This material settles into your bones for a short time and allows your doctor to detect bone disease much earlier than when using typical X-ray.<br />It’s a comfortable procedure that takes about three to four hours, which includes time for the injected material to settle and for the actual scan (X-ray).<br />Why is a bone scan important to your health?<br />A bone scan is an important tool to quickly detect the source of various symptoms you may have experienced like bone pain or swelling. Early detection is essential to prevent fractures or the spread of disease or infection through your bones. You and your doctor can discuss the most effective treatments based on your bone scan results.<br />",

      "understanding": "<a></a><br />Understanding Diabetes<br /><a href='#collapse1'>What is diabetes?</a><br />What most people refer to as “diabetes” is actually a group of diseases called diabetes mellitus. These diseases affect your body’s ability to turn the sugar (or glucose) in your blood into energy.<br />Your body uses insulin to change glucose so it can be used by cells for energy. Based on what diabetes type you have, your body either doesn’t produce enough insulin or doesn’t use it properly.<br />If it’s not treated, any form of diabetes can lead to death or serious complications such as:<br />Amputation.<br />Blindness.<br />Diabetic retinopathy.<br />Heart and vascular disease.<br />Kidney failure.<br />Stroke.<br />Wounds and infections.<br /><a href='/assets/documents/medical-services/diabetes/diabetes-101-booklet.pdf'>Download this free Diabetes 101 booklet </a><br /><a href='#collapse2'>What are the symptoms?</a><br />The signs, symptoms and severity of diabetes depends on the type. It’s also based on how high your blood sugar is. Some people don’t have symptoms right away, but some common signs include:<br />Blurred vision.<br />Constant thirst.<br />Extreme hunger.<br />Fatigue.<br />Frequent infections.<br />Frequent urination.<br />Irritability.<br />Rapid weight loss.<br />Slow-healing sores.<br /><a href='#collapse3'>What are the types of diabetes?</a><br />Type 1 diabetes<br />Type 1 diabetes, often called “insulin-dependent diabetes,” happens when your body stops making insulin. It’s most common in children but can be diagnosed at any age. Symptoms include dry mouth, fatigue and a fruit flavor in your mouth.<br />While type 1 diabetes is a long-term condition that can’t be reversed, you can control it by making healthy lifestyle changes and by using prescribed insulin effectively.<br />Types 2 diabetes<br />Type 2 diabetes, often called “non-insulin dependent diabetes,” happens when your blood sugar level is too high. It’s most common in adults but can be diagnosed at any age. Though sometimes no symptoms are noticed, signs can include extreme hunger, blurry vision and frequent urination.<br />While type 2 diabetes is a chronic condition that can’t be reversed, you can manage it with healthy lifestyle changes, medicine and insulin therapy.<br />Gestational diabetes<br />Gestational diabetes happens during pregnancy when changes in your body cause high blood sugar. It’s possible this short-term condition can be reversed. Since most women don’t notice any symptoms, your obstetrician will monitor your glucose levels often as a part of your prenatal care.<br />You can manage gestational diabetes during your pregnancy, and it often goes away after your baby is born.<br />Prediabetes<br />As a regular part of your primary care, your doctor will test your blood sugar levels periodically (usually yearly). Since it’s possible that prediabetes can be reversed, catching it early is key.<br />You’ll be considered prediabetic if your blood sugar levels are higher than normal, but not high enough to be diagnosed as diabetes. Your doctor will talk with you about important steps you can take to control or reverse your prediabetes.<br />",

Seeing your support team often is crucial to achieving your best health. During your journey, you may be asked to think about:<br />Creating a healthy diet plan with a dietitian’s help.<br />Discussing common treatments for diabetic complications, such as <a href='/services-and-conditions/hyperbaric-medicine'>hyperbaric medicine</a> for <a href='/services-and-conditions/wound-care'>wound care.</a><br />Taking prescribed medicines, including insulin injections.<br />Trying nonmedical and medical <a href='/services-and-conditions/weight-loss'>weight loss</a> treatments and programs.<br />Wearing an emergency ID bracelet that lets people know you have diabetes.<br />Please see a doctor right away if you have symptoms that last more than a few hours or are more serious. These include cuts, wounds and blisters that aren’t healing or are infected, or chest pain, shortness of breath, and pain or numbness in your arms and legs.<br /><a href='#collapse5'>Seek Education Services</a><br />At ProMedica, we know that patients who understand diabetes enjoy a better quality of life than those who aren’t clear about how to handle the disease.

Advice from clinical pharmacist Chuck Riepenhoff, RPH, CDE.<br /><a href='#collapse8'>Understand Good Nutrition</a><br />Good nutrition is key to your good health. It’s one of the most important ways to manage diabetes. The right diet — one rich in nutrients and good fats, but low in calories — will help you control your glucose levels.<br />At ProMedica, our dietitians will work with you to create a diabetes medical nutrition therapy (MNT) diet. It takes into account your health as well as your likes, dislikes and lifestyle. MNT plans are designed just for you and your condition. Focused on fruits, vegetables and whole grains, your MNT plan will be built around a variety of healthy foods. It includes balanced portions and regular meals all through the day, along with wholesome snacks.<br />Medical Nutrition Therapy<br />A meal plan that’s chosen by you and your dietitian helps you maintain a healthy glucose level in your blood. When you eat too many calories and bad fats, your glucose rises in an unhealthy way. Staying on top of what you eat helps keep your glucose in check and avoids problems that come with having high blood sugar.<br />A medical nutrition therapy plan also works well as a safe way to lose weight. Many people with diabetes find that weight loss helps them manage their glucose. Losing weight also improves your health in many other noticeable ways.<br />Best Foods<br />Your ProMedica dietitian will help you select foods that are best for you to manage diabetes. Some of the delicious, nutritious choices for you are:<br />Fiber. Among its many health benefits, fiber helps control blood sugar levels. You’ll want to try these high-fiber foods: whole-grain pasta; garbanzo, black, and white beans; brown rice; apples; guava; strawberries; broccoli; peas; and brussels sprouts.<br />Fish. ProMedica dietitians advise eating fish twice a week. Generally, fish is lower in overall fat, saturated fat and cholesterol. Broil, bake, or poach. Avoid fried. Try tuna, salmon, mackerel and other fish high in Omega-3 fatty acid.<br />Healthy carbs. Carbohydrates are broken into three types: fiber, starches and sugars. Carbs raise your blood glucose. But eating healthy carbs in line with your meal plan helps you keep your blood sugar within a healthy range. Try whole-grain breads, sweet potatoes, quinoa, steel-cut oatmeal, kale and bananas.<br />Healthy fats. As long as you don’t eat too many of them, monounsaturated fats and polyunsaturated fats can lower cholesterol, though they tend to be higher in calories. Try avocados, walnuts, salmon, pumpkin and sesame seeds, olives and olive oil, and navy beans.<br />Foods to Avoid<br />When working toward your health goals you should avoid foods that contain:<br />High sugar. Can be found in candy, desserts and sugar-sweetened beverages such as soda and sweet tea.<br />High salt. Can be found in chips, cured meats, sauces and dressings, and packaged food.<br />High cholesterol. Can be found in butter, bacon, ice cream, lobster and fried foods.<br />Trans fats. Can be found in deep-fried foods, non-dairy creamer, cake mixes and margarine.<br />Saturated fats. Can be found in cheese, butter, fatty beef, chicken with skin and whole milk.<br />",

      "faq": "<a></a><br />Frequently Asked Questions<br />There’s a lot to learn when you or a loved one is diagnosed with diabetes. You’re not alone — many people likely have the same questions you do. That’s why you’ll find answers to the questions we’re asked most often, right here in one place.<br /><a href='#collapse9'>What does insulin do?</a><br />Insulin is the hormone that allows sugar (also called glucose) to enter your cells and be used as energy.<br /><a href='#collapse10'>What is blood glucose?</a><br />Glucose is the fuel our bodies need for energy. If it’s going to be used by our bodies, it needs to get into our cells. When someone has diabetes, the glucose stays in the bloodstream instead of entering the cells. This starves our cells of energy.<br /><a href='#collapse11'>Why do I have to measure my blood sugar (glucose)?</a><br />Blood sugar tests give you vital information about how to manage your condition. Knowing your glucose level helps you:<br />Reach your treatment goals.<br />Understand how your daily choices in diet, exercise or stress levels affect your condition.<br />Understand how your medicine works for you.<br /><a href='#collapse12'>How do I measure my blood sugar (glucose) levels?</a><br />Your blood glucose can be measured by placing a blood drop on a strip that a glucose monitor can read. Your doctor will work closely with you to decide how often you should be testing your blood sugar. It’s common to test it several times each day.<br /><a href='#collapse13'>What could happen if I don’t know my blood sugar (glucose) levels?</a><br />Most of the time people don’t know if their blood sugar is under control since it’s constantly changing throughout the day. That’s why it’s a good idea to check your blood sugar levels at various times of the day to be sure your blood sugar is under control.<br /><a href='#collapse14'>What is the A1C test?</a><br />The A1C test is a blood test that shows your average blood sugar level over the past three months.<br /><a href='#collapse15'>What do food choices have to do with diabetes?</a><br />Carbohydrates are our major energy source and have the greatest effect on blood sugar. High-fiber carbohydrate foods like whole-grain bread, whole fruits, legumes, nuts and oats digest slower. That helps keep blood sugar from getting too high.<br /><a href='#collapse16'>What does exercise have to do with diabetes?</a><br />Exercise helps insulin work more efficiently and can help keep blood sugar in a normal range. Talk with your doctor about which exercise program is right for you.<br /><a href='#collapse17'>Is there a medicine I can take for diabetes?</a><br />If you have Type 1 diabetes, insulin must be taken every day because your body doesn’t make its own. A wide range of oral and injectable medicines can also be used to help control your Type 2 diabetes.<br /><a href='#collapse18'>Should I be concerned about a cut, wound or blister that won’t heal?</a><br />Any time you notice a break in your skin that heals slowly, talk to your doctor. Wound care and diabetic vascular disease specialists provide treatment and also teach you how to care for your wounds at home.<br />",

      "articleContent": "<br />Understanding Depression<br />Major depression is a chronic condition and different than just experiencing the occasional “blues”. If you have depression, it consistently affects your mood, thoughts and body.<br />Symptoms of Depression<br />You may notice several of the following signs during the same two-week period:<br />Difficulty with relationships<br />Excessive guilt<br />Hopelessness<br />Extremely sensitive to failure or rejection<br />Unable to concentrate<br />Lack energy<br />Lack interest in activities once enjoyed<br />Persistent sadness<br />Irritability, hostility, or aggression<br />Feeling of wanting to die<br />Changes in appetite or weight<br />Low self-esteem<br />Sleeping too much or very little<br />Thinking about suicide or attempting suicide<br />In most cases, treatment is necessary for recovery. Begin a conversation about your depression with your primary care physician, or look for a behavioral health specialist such as a counselor or psychiatrist.<br />Depression in Children and Adolescents<br />According to the National Institute of Mental Health, the onset of major depression is occurring much earlier in life than it used to. And the earlier the condition onsets, the higher the probability that it will continue into adulthood.<br />If your adolescent has major depression, they are unable to merely “snap out of it” and feel better on their own.<br />What should you do if your think your child has major depression? Contact your pediatrician or family doctor immediately to discuss. Early diagnosis of depression is important because it often coexists with another psychiatric disorder, such as substance abuse or anxiety disorder. If your doctor feels your child needs further assessment, they may recommend evaluation by a licensed behavioral health professional. Major depression can be effectively treated.<br />",

    "content": {
      "articleContent": "<br />About Diabetic Retinopathy<br />Diabetic eye disease refers to a group of eye problems that people with <a href='/services-and-conditions/diabetes'>diabetes </a>could face. These conditions may include diabetic retinopathy, cataracts and glaucoma. Although eye diseases can cause severe vision loss or even blindness, they can often be treated before vision loss occurs. Prevention is the key.<br />Frequently Asked Questions<br /><a href='#faq1'>What is diabetic retinopathy?</a><br />Diabetic retinopathy is the most common eye disease in people with diabetes and is a leading cause of blindness in American adults. Changes in the blood vessels of the retina, the light sensitive layer of tissue at the back of the inner eye, can lead to this condition. In some people, retinal blood vessels may swell and leak fluid. In others, abnormal new blood vessels grow on the surface of the retina. These changes may result in vision loss or blindness.<br /><a href='#faq2'>Who is at risk for diabetic retinopathy?</a><br />Anyone with diabetes is at risk for diabetic retinopathy. The longer you have diabetes, the more likely you are to develop diabetic retinopathy. Your risk rises if you have diabetes and you smoke, have high blood pressure, or are pregnant.<br /><a href='#faq6'>What are the symptoms of diabetic retinopathy?</a><br />In the early stages of diabetic retinopathy, you may have no symptoms. Vision may not change until the disease gets worse. Then you may have blurry or double vision; dark or floating spots; pain or pressure in one or both eyes; or rings, flashing lights, or blank spots in your vision.<br />A decrease in your central vision could be caused by macular edema which may occur from diabetic retinopathy. It happens when the macula, a part of the retina, swells from the leaking fluid and causes blurred vision. When new vessels grow on the surface of the retina, they can bleed into the eye. This may decrease vision.<br /><a href='#faq7'>How is diabetic retinopathy diagnosed?</a><br />Along with a complete health history and eye exam, your eye care professional may do these tests to diagnose diabetic retinopathy:<br />Visual acuity test. This is the common eye chart test that measures vision ability at various distances.<br />Tonometry. This standard test is done to check the pressure (intraocular pressure, or IOP) inside the eye.<br />Pupil dilation. For a close up exam of the eye’s lens and retina, your pupil is widened with eye drops.<br />Ophthalmoscopy. This is a test where a doctor looks very closely at the retina using a special magnifying glass.<br />Fluorescein angiography. In this test, a dye is injected into the bloodstream. The dye helps the blood vessels in the eye show up while pictures are taken with a special camera. This test lets the doctor see if the blood vessels are leaking.<br />Optical coherence tomography. In this test, light waves are used to make detailed images of the retina.<br /><a href='#faq8'>How is diabetic retinopathy treated?</a><br />If you have diabetic retinopathy, your treatment will depend on your age, general health, symptoms and the severity of the condition.<br />Even people with advanced retinopathy have a good chance of keeping their vision if they are treated before the retina becomes severely damaged. Treatment for diabetic retinopathy may include:<br />Laser surgery. This involves shrinking the abnormal blood vessels, or sealing the leaking ones.<br />Vitrectomy. Vitrectomy is a procedure that involves removing the cloudy, jelly-like substance (vitreous) that fills the center of the eye. The vitreous is replaced with a saline solution.<br />Injections. Certain medications can be injected into the eye to slow the growth of the abnormal vessels of the retina.<br /><a href='#faq9'>Can diabetic retinopathy be prevented? </a><br />While you can’t completely prevent diabetic retinopathy, you can reduce your risk of getting it. Controlling your blood sugar slows the start of retinopathy and keeps it from getting worse. It also lessens the need for laser surgery for severe retinopathy.<br />You can reduce the risk of developing the condition by:<br />Having a dilated eye exam once a year. An eye exam does not prevent retinopathy but it can help diagnose eye problems that can then be treated. An eye exam can also alert you and your healthcare provider if the diabetes needs to be better controlled.<br />Having an eye exam before pregnancy or in the first trimester of your pregnancy. If you’re pregnant and take insulin to manage your diabetes, that can raise the odds that the condition will become worse. Continue to be monitored every trimester and for 1 year after birth depending on how severe the retinopathy is.<br />",

      "devices": "<a></a><br />Heart Devices for Abnormal Heart Rhythms<br />Your heartbeat is started and controlled by a natural electrical system. It coordinates the contractions that pump blood through your heart and out to the rest of your body.<br />Based on your age and overall health, your heart contracts and dilates 60 to 100 times a minute. But when your heart has trouble starting a heartbeat or naturally pacing your heart rhythm, your body may not get enough blood.<br />Pacemakers and implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICD) are the two types of heart devices that treat irregular heartbeats. A surgeon implants one of these devices to send electrical pulses to your heart. This should reset your heart to its normal rhythm.<br />ProMedica’s experienced team of cardiac electrophysiologists will help you decide if a pacemaker or an ICD is the best way to treat your abnormal heart rhythm. They’re highly skilled at implanting these devices and the procedures can be done close to home in the Heart Rhythm Center at ProMedica Toledo Hospital.<br /><a href='#collapse1'>Pacemakers</a><br />You may first notice signs of autism before your child turns three. But they most often appear within the first 12 to 18 months.<br />Pacemakers are small devices that generate pulses to prompt the heart to beat normally. There are two types of pacemakers — biventricular and leadless pacemakers.<br />Biventricular pacemakers are used for ventricles (heart chambers) that don’t contract at the same time. They work to pace both ventricles to contract in unison.<br />Leadless pacemakers are a newer type of pacemaker technology that removes the need for a surgical pocket and insulated wires (known as “leads”) to pace the heart. Instead, the leadless pacemaker is a self-contained generator and electrode system that’s implanted directly into the right ventricle. Since it is only placed in one ventricle, it is also called a ventricular pacemaker.<br /><a href='#collapse2'>Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillator (ICD)</a><br />An implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) is similar to a pacemaker. Some ICDs even have pacemakers built into them. An ICD device can send the same type of low-energy pulses to your heart that pacemakers do, but it can also detect more life-threatening arrhythmias. Then it will send a high-energy pulse if an arrhythmia becomes dangerous or your heart stops beating. For this reason, ICDs are advised for patients who are at high risk for a life-threatening ventricular arrhythmia.<br /><a href='#collapse3'>Subcutaneous Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillator (S-ICD)</a><br />A subcutaneous implantable cardioverter defibrillator (S-ICD) has all of the benefits of an ICD with less risk because it’s not attached to the heart. S-ICDs are placed under the skin and are safer to implant because there’s no risk of injuring a blood vessel.<br />Carla's Story<br /><a> <img src='http://i3.ytimg.com/vi/v4WU6s5BIXM/maxresdefault.jpg' alt /></a><br />Find out how an S-ICD helped Carla Phillips regain the confidence to live on her own after a cardiomyopathy diagnosis.<br />",

With endoscopy services at ProMedica locations all around the Toledo metro area, you won’t have to go far for your procedure.

It lets your doctor analyze the health of your colon, esophagus, lungs, stomach, portions of the small intestine and pancreas. Using advanced technology, ProMedica gastroenterologists take a closer look at these areas of the body to diagnose infections, ulcers, cancers and other possible causes of pain or discomfort.<br />Most endoscopic procedures include mild sedation. They take anywhere from 15 to 90 minutes, based on the type. Our doctors will talk with you about your symptoms and concerns. Then they’ll form a plan to examine and treat you that works best for your health needs.<br />",

      "procedures": "<a></a><br />Common Endoscopic Procedures<br />The most common endoscopic procedures include colonoscopy, upper GI endoscopy, flexible sigmoidoscopy, endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography and liver biopsy.<br />We want you to feel comfortable and informed about your procedure. Talk with your doctor about the risks and possible side effects. Our goal is to have you home in no time, with the peace of mind that your diagnosis is accurate.<br /><a href='#collapse1'>Colonoscopy</a><br />A colonoscopy is a visual exam of your colon using a lighted, flexible fiberoptic or video endoscope. An endoscope is inserted through your anus and moved gently around the bends of your colon. Viewing the colon like this helps your doctor check for conditions like colon cancer, noncancerous tumors (which can be painlessly removed during the colonoscopy), inflammation, infection and bleeding. A colonoscopy can be performed by a general surgeon, a gastroenterologist, or a colorectal surgeon.<br />Easy-to-schedule Colon Cancer Screenings<br />Our open access colonoscopy program makes it easier to get colon cancer screenings. The program allows healthy people, age 50 and older and with an average risk for colon cancer, to schedule a colonoscopy without having an office visit first. You’ll save both time and the cost of an office co-payment.<br /><a href='/services-and-conditions/endoscopy/open-access-colonoscopy-program'> Learn more about our open access colonoscopy program.</a><br /><a href='#collapse2'>Endoscopic Retrograde Cholangiopancreatography</a><br />Also known as ERCP, this procedure is used to diagnose problems in the pancreas, bile duct, liver and gallbladder. ERCP may help treat gallstones or other blockages, where stenting or sphincterotomy to open the bile duct is needed.<br />A local anesthetic is sprayed to numb your throat and an endoscope is gently inserted through your mouth and down your throat. Your doctor then inspects your stomach and duodenum (the first section of the small intestine). A dye is injected into your duodenum and detailed X-rays are taken of the bile ducts and pancreas.<br /><a href='#collapse3'>Endoscopic Ultrasound</a><br />Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) is a minimally invasive procedure to evaluate digestive (gastrointestinal) and lung diseases. It uses high-frequency sound waves to produce detailed images of the lining and walls of your digestive tract and chest, nearby organs such as the pancreas and liver, and the lymph nodes.<br /><a href='#collapse4'>Flexible Sigmoidoscopy</a><br />A flexible sigmoidoscopy is used to diagnose and treat rectal bleeding, persistent diarrhea, pain, colon cancer and abnormalities that may appear on X-rays. An endoscope looks at the inside of your rectum and sigmoid colon (the last one to two feet of your colon).<br />During the exam, you'll lie on your left side with your legs drawn up and a sheet placed over your lower body. A finger exam of your anus and rectum is performed, and then an endoscope is gently inserted into the rectum. The bowel is inflated with air to expand it and allow careful examination. The endoscope is then carefully moved around the various bends in the lower bowel.<br /><a href='#collapse5'>Liver Biopsy</a><br />A liver biopsy lets the doctor take a small sample of liver tissue to view under a microscope and diagnose a condition. A local anesthetic is used to numb the skin and tissue and a thin needle is inserted through the skin, usually through the lower-right chest between the ribs. The needle is quickly moved into and out of the liver (in about one to two seconds) to take a piece of tissue.<br /><a href='#collapse6'>Upper GI Endoscopy</a><br />An upper GI endoscopy is a visual exam of your upper intestinal tract using a lighted, flexible fiberoptic or video endoscope. A spray or liquid is used to numb your throat so you don’t feel the endoscope as it’s gently inserted into your upper esophagus. This exam is used to diagnose and treat ulcers, tumors, trouble with swallowing, upper abdominal pain, indigestion, chronic inflammation and intestinal bleeding.<br />",
      "beforeAfter": "<a></a><br />Before and After Your Endoscopy<br /><a href='#collapse7'>How do I prepare for an endoscopy?</a><br />Before your endoscopy, you will have a first-time visit and consultation with your gastroenterologist. This is a chance for you to discuss your condition and symptoms so we can learn about your health. Usually, no procedures are done on your first visit.<br />Our physicians ask that you have a doctor’s order for the endoscopy. Please arrive 30 minutes before your scheduled appointment time if you’re a new patient and fifteen minutes ahead if you’re a follow-up. If you arrive fifteen minutes after your scheduled appointment time, your appointment will need to be rescheduled. Please bring your informed consent form.<br />As endoscopy procedures vary, please talk with your physician for instructions regarding preparations for your endoscopy.<br /><a href='#collapse8'>After Your Endoscopic Procedure</a><br />After your endoscopy, your physician will share your test results with you and your visitor (with your permission). You'll be monitored for at least 30 minutes before you’re sent home. Your doctor will also give you a discharge instruction sheet.<br />Because you’ll be sedated during your endoscopy, it’s important to limit your activity afterward.<br />No drinking alcoholic beverages.<br />No driving or operating any equipment.<br />No important decision-making.<br />No working.<br />You may resume all of your usual activities the next day.<br />",

And taking steps every day, as recommended by your eye care provider, will go a long way. Whether that means using eye drops when your eyes are dry, itchy or irritated or properly cleaning and using needed eyewear, treat your eyes like the important organ they are.<br />And, since some eye diseases don’t show early warning signs, it’s important you remember to get your eyes checked as often as your healthcare provider tells you to, or if you have any new vision problems.<br /><a href='#collapse1'>Get Routine Vision Screenings</a><br />Regular eye exams are the best way to understand and protect your eye health. Early diagnosis will make sure you get proper treatment that could help save your eyesight. This is especially vital for eye conditions that don’t have clear, early signs or symptoms.<br />At ProMedica’s eye care centers, we use leading-edge technology to perform exams, adjust eyeglass prescriptions and treat eye problems. Our methods include:<br />Fluorescein angiography (retinal imaging).<br />HRT (three-dimensional imaging).<br />OCT cross-sectional imaging.<br />Pentacam®.<br />VISX™ Star S4 IR™.<br />Our ProMedica eye care specialists recommend regular checkups for eye health at every stage of life. Keep these guidelines in mind:<br />Children who have no family history of eye disease or symptoms should have their eyes examined by their pediatrician as part of their regular well-child check-ups. Children should have a complete eye exam by an eye care professional before they start school, and then every two years after. <a href='/services-and-conditions/eye-care-children'>Learn more.</a><br />A complete eye exam is recommended for adults who have good vision and healthy eyes with no family history of eye disease or symptoms. This should be done at least one time between ages 20 and 29 and at least two times between ages 30 and 39.<br />If you’re an adult with no symptoms or eye disease risk factors, the American Academy of Ophthalmology now recommends a baseline complete eye exam at age 40 to screen for eye diseases. Between the ages of 40 and 60, adults should follow up at the times that are recommended by their eye doctor. This will depend on factors that are evaluated at the baseline exam.<br />Older adults ages 60 and over should have a complete eye exam every one or two years. The exam should check for eye diseases such as diabetic retinopathy, glaucoma, age-related macular degeneration and cataracts. People with a family history of eye disease or other risk factors should see their eye care doctor more often.<br /><a href='#collapse2'>Follow Eye Safety Tips</a><br />Protect your eyes during your daily routine and planned activities. Be sure to wear:<br />One-piece plastic sports frames with polycarbonate lenses when playing sports or recreational activities.<br />Plastic safety goggles when working with household cleaning products, weed-killers, fertilizers and other chemicals, or with power tools and yard equipment.<br />Sunglasses that block 100% of both UVA and UVB radiation whenever you spend time outdoors. Gray, green and brown lenses provide the most protection.<br />Wraparound frames when you spend a lot of time outdoors in bright sunlight.<br /><a href='#collapse3'>Take Care of Your Eyewear</a><br />If you wear contact lenses, keep these guidelines in mind:<br />Clean and disinfect your lenses' carrying case often. Use a new case every six months.<br />Don't put contact lenses in your mouth or dampen them with saliva.<br />Don't go to sleep with your contact lenses in. The only time to do this is when the lenses are made to be worn day and night. Sleeping with them in can raise your chances of getting an infection by about 10 times.<br />Don't use homemade saline solutions.<br />Carefully follow lens care and wearing instructions.<br />See your eye care provider if you have pain wearing lenses or you have any change in your vision.<br />Wash your hands thoroughly before handling your lenses.<br /><a href='#collapse4'>Avoid Eye Strain</a><br />There’s no doubt that using a computer strains your eyes. It's important to think about your eyes when you’re working on the computer. It’s part of doing all you can to protect your valuable sight.<br />Adjust the angle of the computer screen to cut down on reflections from overhead lights and desk lamps.<br />Adjust the screen 20 to 25 inches away from your eyes and slightly below eye level.<br />Follow the 20-20-20 rule. Every 20 minutes take a 20-second break and focus your eyes on an object 20 feet away.<br />Keep the screen’s brightness as bright or brighter than other bright objects in the room.<br />Place the screen at right angles to any windows to cut down on glare. Use a filter that reduces glare or, if glare is an ongoing problem, use a computer hood with three sides.<br />Use an adjustable holder for papers. Adjust the holder so your reference materials are at the same height and distance from you as the computer screen.<br />Use artificial tears to refresh your eyes when they feel dry.<br />Wipe the screen often with an anti-static cloth.<br /><a href='/assets/documents/medical-services/eye-care/annual-eye-exam-infographic.pdf'> Learn about the importance of your annual eye exam.</a><br />",
      "eyewear": "<a></a><br />Eyewear and Treatment Options<br />Eyewear<br />You have a lot of options when it comes to correcting your vision. A basic pair of glasses, disposable contact lenses, designer frames, tinted or progressive eyeglass lenses — the choices may seem endless.

      "faq": "<a></a><br />Frequently Asked Questions<br />We need our sight to see and make sense of the world. The health of your eyes is vital to your quality of life. But if it’s been a while since your last vision exam, you may feel overwhelmed by all the information that’s covered. Here are some of the questions you’re likely to discuss with your eye doctor.<br /><a href='#collapse12'>What is “20/20” vision?</a><br />When you hear that someone has “20/20” vision it usually means they have good eyesight and don’t need eyeglasses. The phrase “20/20 vision” refers to normal vision and a person’s ability to read a certain row of letters on a standard vision chart from 20 feet away.<br /><a href='#collapse13'>Why is it important to have a dilated eye exam?</a><br />Dilation lets your eye doctor view the inside of your eyes and check their health. During a dilated eye exam, the doctor can see signs and symptoms of vision problems, eye diseases and even other health conditions such as diabetes, high blood pressure and high cholesterol.<br /><a href='#collapse14'>What does it mean if you are nearsighted, farsighted or have an astigmatism?</a><br />Nearsightedness, farsightedness and astigmatism are all refractive disorders and are the most common eye problems in the United States. If you’re nearsighted, it means you’re able to see objects clearly up-close, while objects in the distance are blurry. If you’re farsighted, you’re able to see objects clearly in the distance and up-close objects are blurry. Having an astigmatism means your cornea is shaped like a football, which causes objects both near and far to be distorted and out of focus.<br /><a href='#collapse15'>Sometimes I see spots or things that seem to float. Is that a sign of something serious?</a><br />In most cases, spots or “floaters” are very common and are a part of the natural aging process. As we get older, the vitreous (the clear, gel-like substance that fills the inside of the eye) tends to shrink slightly, detach from the retina and form clumps within the eye. What you see are the shadows these clumps cast on the retina, the light-sensitive nerve layer that lines the back of the eye.<br />Floaters can get in the way of clear vision, often when reading. Try looking up and then down to move the floaters out of the way. While some floaters may remain, many of them will fade over time.<br />If you have a sudden “flash” of light or rush of floaters, you may have a tear in your retina, or your retina may be detaching from the back of the eye. This is a serious problem that must be treated by a healthcare provider as soon as possible to avoid losing vision permanently.<br /><a href='#collapse16'>Is glaucoma curable?</a><br />Currently, there is no cure for glaucoma. Vision that’s lost because of glaucoma can’t be restored. That’s why complete dilated eye exams are critical to diagnose glaucoma. Then treatment can begin before permanent damage occurs.<br /><a href='#collapse17'>What is a cataract and am I going blind?</a><br />Cataracts are cloudy areas that form on the natural lens of the eye. Cataracts keep light from passing to the retina. This makes it hard to see at night and causes objects to look blurry, hazy and dull. Cataracts are one of the most common eye conditions in the United States and are treated with surgery. If left untreated, cataracts cause ongoing vision loss and can lead to legal blindness or even total blindness.<br /><a href='#collapse18'>Why do I need to return for a contact lens check?</a><br />You need a contact lens check if you’re new to wearing contact lenses or your contact lens brand or prescription has changed. A contact lens check makes sure that both lenses fit on the eye properly and it also shows the quality of your vision with the new lenses.<br />",
      "conditions": "<a></a><br />Common Eye Conditions and Diseases<br />At ProMedica Eye Care, our expert physicians and clinical staff have experience with the most effective, advanced procedures to treat eye conditions and diseases.<br /><a href='#collapse5'>Cataracts</a><br />Cataracts are cloudy areas in a person’s normally clear eye lens that blocks the passage of light to the retina. Cataracts can cause a person to be more sensitive to light glare and can make it hard to see, especially at night. Cataract patients often have dull visual sharpness, color and form, and a halo effect around lights.<br /><a href='#collapse6'>Chronic Dry Eye</a><br />Chronic dry eye develops when the eye does not produce enough tears or the eyelid’s structure keeps tear film from forming evenly over the surface of the eye. The eye’s naturally produced tear film dries up too quickly, and the composition of tears is not normal.<br /><a href='#collapse7'>Diabetic Retinopathy</a><br />Diabetic retinopathy be caused by long-term diabetes and it usually affects both eyes. It’s often symptom-free until the last stage, which can cause rapid, permanent eye damage and vision loss. The symptoms of diabetic retinopathy may include:<br />Blank or dark areas in your field of vision.<br />Blurred vision.<br />Colors appear washed out or different.<br />Floaters (spots, dots or cobweb-like dark strings floating in your vision).<br />Poor night vision.<br />Vision that sometimes changes from blurry to clear.<br /><a href='/services-and-conditions/diabetic-retinopathy'> Learn more about diabetic retinopathy care with ProMedica.</a><br /><a href='#collapse8'>Flashes and Floaters</a><br />Flashes and floaters appear as small specks or clouds moving in your field of vision. They’re more common as we approach middle-age.<br />Floaters are actually tiny clumps of cells or material inside the vitreous, which is the clear, gel-like fluid that fills the inside of your eye. Once that vitreous gel begins to shrink, the posterior vitreous detaches itself from the back wall of the eye. This results in floaters and flashes.<br /><a href='#collapse9'>Glaucoma</a><br />Glaucoma is created when fluid builds up because it’s not able to naturally drain out of the eye. This fluid build-up raises the pressure in the eye. It can lead to permanent optic nerve damage with partial or even total vision loss. If caught early, glaucoma can usually be controlled.<br />There are several types of glaucoma:<br />Angle-closure.<br />Congenital or “childhood.”<br />Irido corneal endothelial syndrome (ICE).<br />Neovascular.<br />Normal tension.<br />Pigmentary.<br />Primary open-angle (POAG).<br /><a href='#collapse10'>Macular Degeneration</a><br />Macular degeneration affects the part of our eyes that lets us see fine details. It’s part of the body's natural aging process and is more common in those over age 75.<br />There are two classifications of macular degeneration: dry macular degeneration and wet macular degeneration.<br />Dry macular degeneration affects one or both eyes and can make distance vision or reading vision blurry. If you have this condition, you may need more bright light to see up close and colors appear less vivid or bright. You may have hazy vision or trouble seeing when you enter a dimly lit room from the bright outdoors. You may not be able to easily recognize people's faces, and there’s a blank or blurry spot in your central vision.<br />Wet macular degeneration symptoms usually appear and get worse quickly. Colors lose their brightness and don’t look the same for each eye. The size of objects may also look different for each eye. You may have distorted vision (straight lines will appear bent, crooked or irregular), dark gray spots or blank spots in your vision. You may also lose your central vision.<br /><a href='#collapse11'>Retinal Detachment</a><br />Retinal detachment happens when the light-sensitive membrane in the eye separates from the layers that support it. Some signs that your retina has detached are:<br />A sudden appearance of flashes, which could be the first stage of a retinal tear or detachment.<br />A sudden decrease in your vision.<br />A sudden increase in size and number of floaters.<br />Having a shadow appear in the periphery (side) of your field of vision.<br />Seeing a gray curtain move across your field of vision.<br />Eye Styes and Blepharitis<br /><a> <img src='http://i3.ytimg.com/vi/fJnb-c1nMAY/maxresdefault.jpg' alt /></a><br />Eye styes are painful and can lead to bigger problems.

That’s why it’s important for children to get regular eye care. ProMedica’ eye care team can make sure their eyes are healthy and detect and correct eye problems in their early stages.<br />We recommend that infants be closely checked by their pediatrician and have their first eye exam when they’re six months old. Children should have more eye exams when they enter preschool at age three and before they start kindergarten at age five or six. School age children should visit an eye doctor for a complete vision screening every one to two years.<br />Common pediatric eye conditions include:<br />Amblyopia (lazy eye).<br />Blocked tear duct.<br />Cataract (cloudy eyes).<br />Cellulitis (an infection of the eyelid that’s related to trauma or an upper respiratory problem).<br />Chalazion (small lump on the eyelid).<br />Conjunctivitis (pink eye).<br />Juvenile macular degeneration.<br />Pediatric glaucoma.<br />Ptosis (drooping of the upper eyelid).<br />Sty (a red, sore lump near the edge of the eyelid).<br />",

But all parents should know the warning signs of vision problems. Use these guidelines to help you know how to properly care for the eyes at every stage of childhood.<br /><a href='#collapse1'>Birth to Four Months Old</a><br />Most babies’ eyes occasionally look misaligned (this is called strabismus). After four months of age, inward crossing or outward drifting that happens often is considered abnormal. If you notice crossing or drifting, let your child's doctor know.<br /><a href='#collapse2'>Babies Older Than Three Months</a><br />Infants older than three months should be able to follow or track an object, like a toy or ball, with their eyes as it moves across their field of vision. If your baby can't make steady eye contact by this age or doesn’t seem able to see, report this to your doctor.<br /><a href='#collapse3'>Toddlers and Preschoolers</a><br />Many vision problems have no warning signs. So, children often don’t notice it and most likely won’t complain about vision problems. That's why it's important to have your child's eyes checked. Even if your child can’t read yet, your doctor can do special vision tests.<br /><a href='#collapse4'>All Children</a><br />If you notice any of the following, have your child's eyes checked by an eye care professional:<br />Eyes that flutter from side to side or up and down.<br />White or grayish-white color in the pupil.<br />Bulging eye(s) or drooping eyelid(s).<br />Pus or crust in either eye; or eye pain, itchiness or discomfort.<br />Redness in either eye that doesn't go away in a few days.<br />Eyes that are always watery, sensitive to light or both.<br />Other signs that your child may have a vision problem that and needs a complete eye exam:<br />Avoiding up-close tasks.<br />Complaining of headaches or tired eyes.<br />Blinking or rubbing their eyes too much.<br />Having a short attention span.<br />Holding reading materials too close or sitting too close to the television.<br />Poor hand-eye coordination.<br />Tilting their head, squinting, or closing one eye to see better.<br />Using a finger to follow along or losing their place while reading.<br />",
      "safety": "<a></a><br />Keep Your Child's Eyes Safe<br />The best safeguard against childhood eye injuries is taking steps to prevent them — and, when children are old enough to understand, teaching them safety practices when enjoying certain activities. Some tips include:<br />Give your children safety glasses when they're playing with chemistry sets, workshop tools or toys that fire objects.<br />Have your children wear the correct goggles when skiing, snowboarding, and riding on snowmobiles. They should wear helmets with face guards when playing football, ice hockey, roller hockey and other high-impact sports.<br />Keep children away from activities like snow blowing, mowing, working with power tools or hand tools, using cleaning agents, applying fertilizer or weed-killer, or doing other work that can be harm eyes.<br />Keep children away from fireworks, firecrackers and other flammable materials.<br />Treatment for Misaligned Eyes in Children<br /><a> <img src='http://i3.ytimg.com/vi/Wwnezzc_FJk/maxresdefault.jpg' alt='Treatment for Misaligned Eyes in Children' /></a><br />Pediatric Ophthalmologist Dr. Michelle Ariss explains treatment options for misaligned eyes, a condition where children’s eyes don’t look in the same direction.<br />Eye Styes and Blepharitis<br /><a> <img src='https://placedog.net/240/170' alt /></a><br />Eye styes are painful and can lead to bigger problems.

      "articleContent": "<br />Helping You Understand and Manage Your Cancer Risk<br />When there’s a family history of cancer, the idea of a possible cancer diagnosis can bring a lot of anxiety about the future. But what if we could help limit the unknowns and ease some of your fears?<br />When you need answers, you can count on the ProMedica genetic counseling team. We’ll help you determine if genetic testing is right for you and your family — and if testing is needed, we’ll be there every step of the way. Together, we’ll help you manage your cancer risk and take charge of your health.<br />",

      "whatIs": "<a></a><br />What Is Genetic Counseling?<br />Our genes act like instructions for our body’s cells. They help decide what we look like and how our body is built.<br />Sometimes our genes change, or they look different from normal genes. This is called a mutation. Mutations can affect how cells in your body behave. In some cases, a mutation can raise your risk for cancer.<br />Scientists have found certain gene mutations can raise the risk for certain cancers. For example, mutated BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes can raise the risk for ovarian and breast cancers.<br />When parents pass one of these gene mutations to their children, it’s called a hereditary cancer syndrome. Families with this syndrome are more likely to have cancer.<br />Genetic counseling and testing can help show if you or family members have a hereditary cancer syndrome. If you have the syndrome, you can work with your doctor to come up with a prevention plan. This plan can include regular cancer screenings, lifestyle changes and preventive surgery.<br /><a href='#collapse1'>Know When to Test</a><br />Some cancers are linked to certain genetic mutations. You may want to think about having genetic testing if you or a family member have been diagnosed with:<br />Breast cancer before age 50.<br />Breast cancer in both breasts (bilateral breast cancer).<br />Colorectal cancer before age 50.<br />Endometrial cancer before age 50.<br />Male breast cancer.<br />Metastatic prostate cancer.<br />Ovarian cancer.<br />Pancreatic cancer.<br />You may also consider genetic testing if you have:<br />A relative with a BRCA gene mutation.<br />Family members of Ashkenazi Jewish descent who have had breast cancer at any age.<br />More than one family member with the same kind of cancer.<br />Several family members who had cancer at a young age.<br /><a href='#collapse2'>What to Expect During Counseling and Testing</a><br />If you believe you could benefit from a hereditary risk assessment, discuss with your physician. If the two of you decide you are an appropriate candidate, your physician will refer you to our genetic services. Our program is run by board-certified, licensed genetic counselors, and is the largest in the region.<br />During this appointment, you’ll talk about your personal and family health history so it’s helpful to prepare this ahead of time. The licensed genetic counselor will discuss options for you and your family. These may include further genetic testing, possible changes to medical screening procedures and frequencies, and other risk reducing options.<br />If genetic testing is deemed appropriate, we’ll refer you to one of the ProMedica hospitals that has genetic testing services. We have nine genetic testing locations in northwest Ohio and southeast Michigan. Once your test results are ready, we’ll go over the results together and come up with a plan for screening and prevention. The genetic counselor will send this plan to your doctor.<br />Prevention plans are different for everyone. They may include starting cancer screenings early, such as mammograms or colonoscopies. Some people also consider preventive surgery. Your genetic counselor will go over all your choices and will answer any questions you have along the way.<br />",

      "faq": "<a></a><br />Frequently Asked Questions<br /><a href='#collapse3'>Are genetic tests covered by insurance?</a><br />Many health insurance plans pay for genetic tests. But you should still check with your own health plan company. Our preauthorization team can help you figure out whether your health plan covers the tests.<br /><a href='#collapse4'>Can genetic tests make a difference if I already know I have a family history of cancer?</a><br />Yes. Genetic tests can help you and your doctor understand your true risk for a hereditary cancer syndrome. These tests can help you make the best choices to screen and prevent cancer.<br /><a href='#collapse5'>Does law prohibit genetic discrimination?</a><br />Yes. Federal law prevents discrimination against people based on their genetic information. Most states also have similar discrimination laws.<br /><a href='#collapse6'>Who can access my genetic test results?</a><br />Genetic test results are completely confidential. Even when health plans pay for tests, the health plan company won’t get the results. We won’t give the test results to anyone unless we have your written permission.<br /><a href='#collapse7'>Which family member should be tested first?</a><br />The person who has been diagnosed with cancer should be the first person to have genetic testing. But, if this person can’t be tested, we can test another family member.<br /><a href='#collapse8'>I had genetic testing a few years ago and my results were negative. Are new tests available?</a><br />Yes. Scientists have found more genes that cause hereditary cancer syndromes. Based on your health history, you may want to have more testing.<br /><a href='#collapse9'>Can men be affected by hereditary cancer syndromes?</a><br />Yes. Both mothers and fathers can pass a hereditary cancer syndrome to their children. Men can also take steps to lower their cancer risk or find cancer early.<br />",

      "services": "<a></a><br />Our Services<br /><a href='#collapse1'>Annual Gynecology Visits</a><br />Our top priority is to keep you well, and that starts with your yearly gynecology checkup. These checkups are important for any girl or woman who is sexually active. If not, these exams should start at age 13 to 15.<br />During this visit, your gynecologist will listen carefully to any symptoms or problem you may have. You may also have some of the following tests and procedures:<br />Breast exam: Your gynecologist is an expert at checking for any lumps or other abnormalities in your breasts, and will do it quickly and efficiently.<br />General health check: Your personal and family health history can offer clues to your health today. That’s why we’ll ask about any conditions you or someone in your family have had. Your nurse will also weigh you, take your blood pressure and may also ask you to take blood and urine tests.<br />Internal bimanual exam: This test is done to check for problems in your cervix, uterus, fallopian tubes and ovaries. To complete the bimanual exam, your provider inserts two gloved, lubricated fingers into your vagina while lightly pressing on your abdomen with the other hand. This is done to feel around for any growths or abnormalities.<br />Pap test: This test is done during your pelvic exam to check for cervical cancer and other problems. Your gynecologist uses a small brush to collect cell samples from your cervix, which are sent to a lab for testing.<br />Pelvic exam: It’s normal to feel uneasy about this exam, but it’s important to your health. Your gynecologist will examine your vagina and cervix. You may feel some pressure during this exam, but it shouldn’t be painful.<br />STD tests: If you’re sexually active, you may have a sexually transmitted disease (STD) even if you don’t have symptoms. Your gynecologist may take a swab of cells during your pelvic exam, or order blood or urine tests, to check for STDs such as gonorrhea, chlamydia, syphilis or HIV.<br />Your gynecologist will also help you know how to listen to your body, so you can tell what’s normal and recognize when there may be a problem. For example, many women have <a href='/services-and-conditions/pelvic-health'>chronic pelvic pain</a> yet they suffer in silence. If this includes you, please make an appointment. We’re here to help.<br /><a href='#collapse2'>Birth Control Guidance</a><br />When you choose a method of birth control, you’ll be considering many issues — most of them personal. Your ProMedica gynecologist can give you the information you need to choose which of these options is best for you:<br /> Barrier methods:  This includes condoms, diaphragms, cervical caps and contraceptive sponges. All of these block the sperm from fertilizing the egg.<br /> Birth Control Pills:  With about 12 million women in the United States using birth control pills, they’re by far the most common method of birth control and are proven to prevent pregnancy when you take them correctly.<br /> Hormonal methods:  Birth control pills, a contraceptive implant (Implanon), a contraceptive injection (Depo-Provera), the vaginal ring (NuvaRing) and the contraceptive patch (Ortho Evra) are all examples of hormonal birth control. They keep you from ovulating, so there is no egg for sperm cells to fertilize.<br /> Intrauterine devices (IUDs):  These include the copper IUD (ParaGard) and hormonal IUD (Mirena). Both work by changing the way sperm cells move so they can’t fertilize the egg.<br /> Sterilization:  Tubal ligation, or having your tubes tied, keeps your eggs away from sperm cells. Essure® is a permanent, non-surgical way to keep eggs away from sperm.<br /> Natural family planning, or the rhythm method:  With this type of birth control, you avoid intercourse based on your basal body temperature and your cervical mucus, which can tell you when you will ovulate.<br /><a href='#collapse3'>Gynecology Care for Adolescents</a><br />If you have a young daughter, you’ve probably thought about “the talk.” This can mean talking to her about the body changes she’ll experience with puberty, along with everything that follows as she gets older.<br />We can help with this. Your gynecologist can give you ideas about how to talk with your daughter about sex, sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), and the health care she will need as she grows up.<br />Your Daughter's First Gynecologic Exam<br />This is an important doctor visit, since it can set the tone for your daughter’s future healthcare experiences. The gynecologists at ProMedica understand how to talk with girls and how to put them at ease.<br />Schedule your daughter’s first gynecologic exam when she’s 13 to 15 years old or when she becomes sexually active, whichever comes first. If you don’t know how to talk about sex with your daughter, your gynecologist can give you some ideas for how to proceed.<br /><a href='#collapse4'>Important Immunizations</a><br />There are vaccinations that can protect your daughter from several diseases and may be given before her first gynecologic exam, including:<br /> Cervical cancer vaccine:  Most cervical cancers are caused by human papillomavirus (HPV). Gardasil and Cervarix are FDA-approved vaccines that prevent most cervical cancers if they are given before your daughter is exposed to the HPV virus.<br />Both should be given between the ages of 11 and 12 years, in a series of three injections over a six month period. They can prevent vaginal and vulvar cancer, and Gardasil can also prevent genital warts and anal cancer.<br /> HPV vaccine:  The human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine protects against four major types of HPV. This can help your daughter avoid most genital warts and most cervical cancers.<br />This vaccine is given in three doses, with the first recommended between the ages of 11 and 12 years. The second dose is given one or two months after that, and the third dose is given six months after the first injection.<br /><a href='#collapse5'>Menopause Counseling</a><br />Your sexual health and needs may change around your menopause years. We can recommend a course of action that will help you adjust to your body’s changes. Depending on your symptoms and their causes, we may recommend counseling, education or medication.<br /><a href='/services-and-conditions/menopause'>Learn more about menopause.</a><br /><a href='#collapse6'>Screening and Prevention</a><br />Screenings can point out your risk factors for conditions such as cancer, cardiovascular disease and osteoporosis, which tend to happen later in life. Once you know your risks, you can work with your doctor to determine the best combination of diet, lifestyle changes and medications to help you avoid these conditions. If you are diagnosed with a condition, your doctor will recommend an effective treatment plan.<br /><a href='#collapse7'>Surgical Treatment</a><br />A number of conditions of your reproductive system may require surgery. Surgeons at ProMedica use a state-of-the-art method called da Vinci® Surgical System, which is the least invasive type of gynecologic surgery so you can get back quickly to the activities you enjoy.<br />We use the da Vinci® Surgical System for these surgical procedures:<br />Cervical cancer treatment.<br />Diagnostic laparoscopy.<br />Endometrial cancer and endometriosis treatment.<br />Hysterectomy.<br /><a href='/services-and-conditions/pelvic-health'>Pelvic pain</a> procedures.<br />Pelvic reconstruction.<br />To learn more about gynecologic robotic surgery, call <a href='tel:419-291-4575'>419-291-4575</a><br /><a href='#collapse8'>Lifestyle Assessment</a><br />Your gynecologist plays an important role in your overall health. We can look at all aspects of your lifestyle and help you identify changes you can make to be healthier.<br />We can provide <a href='/services-and-conditions/nutrition-counseling'>dietary education and counseling</a> to help you reduce menopausal symptoms and your risks for cardiovascular disease, osteoporosis and breast cancer. We can also make recommendations for being active to help your heart, your lungs, your mood and manage your weight.<br />Sometimes we may connect you with other services, such as a <a href='/services-and-conditions/weight-loss'>weight reduction</a> program that uses prescription weight-loss medications, a physician-monitored weight-loss program or a consultation with a dietitian. And if you smoke, we can <a href='/services-and-conditions/tobacco-cessation'>help you quit.</a> We’re here to be a partner in your health.<br />",

      "expect": "<a></a><br />What to Expect with HBO Therapy<br />When body tissue is injured, it needs more oxygen to survive. To raise the amount of oxygen in your blood, HBO delivers 100% pure oxygen under a specialized pressure chamber. This higher pressure lets your lungs gather up to three times more oxygen than with normal air pressure. The oxygen-rich blood is carried to your damaged body tissue to help heal wounds more quickly and fight infection.<br /><a href='#collapse1'>Effective Treatment for a Wide Range of Health Conditions</a><br />Although some disorders are mainly treated with hyperbaric oxygen therapy, it's most often combined with other types of medical treatments. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy is an approved treatment for many types of conditions, including:<br />Anemia.<br />Bone infections.<br />Carbon monoxide and cyanide poisoning.<br /><a href='/services-and-conditions/wound-care'>Chronic wounds</a>, including non-healing skin grafts and flaps.<br />Decompression sickness.<br />Diabetic wounds in the feet and legs.<br />Embolism.<br />Necrotic soft tissue infections.<br />Smoke inhalation.<br />Thermal burns.<br />Tissue damage from <a href='/services-and-conditions/radiation-therapy'>radiation</a> treatment.<br />Traumatic injuries that prevent blood from reaching tissues or organs.<br /><a href='#collapse2'>What to Expect Before Treatment</a><br />Before your hyperbaric oxygen treatment, we’ll make sure you’re comfortable and at ease. We can answer any questions you may have about the treatment and what to expect. To help make sure you have the safest, most effective session, please be sure to:<br />Give us a complete list of your prescription and over-the-counter medicines. We need the list to see if you’re taking any medicines that may change your body’s response to oxygen.<br />Report an illness, like a cold or the flu, to your HBO care team. You may need to be treated after your illness is over.<br />Remove watches, jewelry, hearing aids and other prosthetic devices before you begin your treatment.<br />Wash all oil and alcohol-based products out of your hair and off your skin.<br />You may have to take vitamin E about 30 minutes before each treatment.<br /><a href='#collapse3'>What to Expect During Treatment</a><br />During hyperbaric oxygen therapy treatments, you’ll lie comfortably inside the HBO chamber. Because the HBO chamber is clear acrylic, you can see the therapist or nurse during the whole treatment. You can also speak to the staff through the chamber’s intercom. During therapy, you can relax, nap or watch television.<br />After the door to the chamber is closed, the oxygen begins to circulate. The chamber’s pressure, which is prescribed by an HBO physician, is slowly raised over a short time. During this compression period, you may feel fullness in your ears, similar to when you fly in an airplane. The hyperbaric medicine staff offers ways to ease this feeling, but it often goes away once the right amount of pressure is reached.<br />Treatment lasts 120 to 154 minutes, based on your condition. However, some developing conditions may need longer treatment sessions.<br />The number of sessions also varies based on how your body responds to the treatment. You may need HBO therapy over a few days or over several months. Your hyperbaric provider will check on your progress regularly and adjust your therapy plan as needed.<br /><a href='#collapse4'>What to Expect After Treatment</a><br />You shouldn’t notice any side effects from your treatments and should be able to resume your normal daily activities right away. However, in some cases, patients have reported feeling light-headed or tired for a short period of time.<br />Your doctor will monitor your progress throughout your course of treatment and will let you know when HBO sessions are no longer needed.<br />",

But there are factors you can control to lower your risk of heart disease and heart attack. It’s important to understand that a single risk factor makes it more likely you’ll develop heart-related problems. The more of these risk factors you have, the more concerned you need to be about seeking prevention and treatment.<br />High Blood Pressure<br />High blood pressure places extra stress on the walls of your arteries. That’s why you’ll want to keep your blood pressure within a normal range.<br />High Cholesterol<br />High cholesterol raises your risk of heart disease. That means it’s important to check your cholesterol levels regularly.<br />Lack of Physical Activity<br />Exercising makes your heart able to do a better job of pumping blood. It also raises your heart rate, which helps build a healthier heart. Aim for 150 minutes of moderate physical activity each week.<br />Obesity<br />Excess weight makes your heart work harder and raises your risk for high blood pressure, high cholesterol and diabetes.<br />Smoking<br />Nicotine has been shown to narrow arteries and destroy the cells that line your arteries. If you smoke, look for tools that can help you quit.<br /><a href='/services-and-conditions/tobacco-cessation#locations'>Find a ProMedica smoking cessation program.</a><br /><a href='#collapse6'>Stress</a><br />High stress can lead to high blood pressure and then heart disease. Try activities such as yoga, breathing exercises and walking, which have all been shown to help lower stress levels.<br /><a href='#collapse7'>Schedule a Cardiovascular Exam</a><br />Your healthcare provider is your top ally in protecting your heart health. Take ten minutes to schedule your yearly checkup. It’s the first step toward learning about your health status and your risk for cardiovascular diseases. During your appointment, here’s how your doctor will assess your cardiac health:<br />Order or review blood work so you know your total cholesterol and blood sugar numbers.<br />Record your weight and height.<br />Review your personal risk factors for heart disease.<br />Take your blood pressure.<br />Talk to you about your family health history.<br />Track any changes in your health.<br /><a href='#collapse8'>Act Fast During a Heart Attack</a><br />If you think you or someone you’re with is having a <a href='/services-and-conditions/heart-attack'>heart attack</a>, do not drive to a hospital. Call 911 right away.<br />Emergency medical personnel will arrive by ambulance and can provide on-the-scene, life-saving treatment. They can also tell others what they’re seeing and deliver test results to the emergency room.<br />At ProMedica Toledo Hospital, <a href='/location/promedica-toledo-hospital-1'>a cardiologist is available 24 hours a day, seven days a week</a> to make sure we’re ready when you need us most.<br /><a href='/services-and-conditions/heart-attack#toledo'>Learn more about heart attack symptoms.</a><br />",

      "procedures": "<a></a><br />Surgical Heart Procedures<br />From minimally invasive to traditional open procedures, we offer a full range of surgical services for your heart condition, including these common procedures:<br />Atrial Fibrillation Surgery<br /><a href='/services-and-conditions/atrial-fibrillation-afib'>Atrial fibrillation (AFib)</a> is an abnormal heart rhythm (arrhythmia) and is the most common kind of heart rhythm problem. With atrial fibrillation surgery (sometimes called the maze procedure), scar tissue is created through a number of small incisions. This scar tissue stops the abnormal signals that caused the atrial fibrillation. This allows your heart rhythm to return to normal.<br /><a href='/services-and-conditions/atrial-fibrillation-afib'>Learn more about AFib </a><br />Coronary Artery Bypass Surgery<br />Coronary artery bypass graft surgery, or CABG, is a procedure used to treat coronary artery disease. If your arteries become blocked because plaque builds up, you may need bypass surgery. This helps restore oxygen and blood flow from your heart to the rest of your body.<br />Thoracic Aortic Aneurysm Repair<br />A thoracic aortic aneurysm repair is done when the portion of your aorta that runs through your chest needs to be replaced. If you develop a weak spot or the aorta begins to bulge, you may need surgery to repair or remove the aneurysm.<br /><a href='/services-and-conditions/aortic-surgery'>Learn more about aortic surgery</a><br />Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement (TAVR)<br />With TAVR, the aortic valve is replaced using a catheter, which is inserted through a small incision (cut). The artificial valve is expanded inside the existing valve by inflating a balloon.<br /><a href='/services-and-conditions/structural-heart-disease#overview'>Learn more about TAVR </a><br />Valve Surgery<br />Four valves direct blood flow through your heart. Heart valve repair or replacement surgery is needed when your valves are damaged or diseased and don’t work as they should. Your valves can become blocked (a condition called stenosis) or they may leak. This may cause shortness of breath, fatigue and chest pain. Valve surgery can repair or replace mitral, aortic and tricuspid valves, and can be both open and minimally invasive.<br /><a href='/services-and-conditions/valve-surgery'>Learn more about valve surgery </a><br />",

You may be asked to have a blood test to see if you have it, too.<br />Two-thirds of hemophilia patients have inherited hemophilia.<br /><a href='#collapse2'>Hemophilia Symptoms</a><br />If you have hemophilia, you may have symptoms like:<br />Bleeding under a joint, such as the elbow or knee, after a minor injury. In some cases, you may notice bleeding under the joint for no reason.<br />Blood in your urine or stool.<br />Excessive (lots of) bleeding after cutting the inside of your mouth, or after losing a tooth.<br />Lots of bruises, or bruises that are larger than normal. You may also feel a hard lump below the bruise.<br />Nosebleeds that happen for no clear reason.<br />Unusual or excessive bleeding during surgery. In children, this may mean a lot of bleeding after circumcision.<br /><a href='#collapse3'>Hemophilia Types</a><br />There are three different types of hemophilia. Doctors determine your type by looking at which clotting factor you’re missing in your blood.<br />Hemophilia A<br />Hemophilia A, also called “classical” hemophilia, is the most common type and happens when your blood has low levels of clotting factor VIII (8).<br />Hemophilia B<br />Hemophilia B, also called “Christmas disease,” is the second most common type. It happens when your blood has low levels of clotting factor IX (9).<br />Hemophilia C<br />Hemophilia C, also called Rosenthal syndrome, is a rare type of hemophilia. It happens when your blood has low levels of clotting factor XI (11).<br /><a href='#collapse4'>Hemophilia Classifications</a><br />The average person’s blood is made up of 50% or more clotting factor. If you have hemophilia, the severity of your condition will be measured and classified into one of three categories.<br />Severe Hemophilia<br />If you have severe hemophilia, it means less than 1% of your blood is made up of clotting factor. This means you may have excessive bleeding after an injury, surgery or dental work, or you may even bleed for no known reason.<br />Moderate Hemophilia<br />If you have moderate hemophilia, 1-5% of your blood has clotting factor. While most people with moderate hemophilia have excessive bleeding after trauma, surgery or dental work too, they do not have as many episodes of unexplained bleeding.<br />Mild Hemophilia<br />If you have mild hemophilia, it means 5-50% of your blood is made up of clotting factor. Mild hemophilia can cause some extra bleeding during surgery, dental work or after an injury.<br />",

      "understanding": "<a></a><br />Understand High Blood Pressure<br />Knowing your numbers and learning more about the condition can help you take steps to protect yourself from heart disease.<br /><a href='#faq1'>What is high blood pressure?</a><br />Blood pressure refers to the pressure in your arteries as blood flows through them. When your blood pressure is high, your heart is working harder than it should to pump blood through your body. This damages your arteries and can lead to <a href='/services-and-conditions/heart-disease'>heart disease</a>, kidney failure and <a href='/services-and-conditions/stroke'>stroke</a>.<br /><a href='#faq2'>How is blood pressure measured?</a><br />A nurse or doctor places a blood pressure cuff around your upper arm to take your blood pressure. The cuff measures the pressure in your arteries during your heartbeat and when your heart is between beats.<br />These two pressures are assigned separate numbers. Written down, your blood pressure reading may look something like this: 130/95. Your doctor may tell you, “Your blood pressure is 130 over 95.”<br /><a href='#faq3'>What is a healthy blood pressure? </a><br />In a healthy blood pressure reading, the first number is less than 120 and the second number is less than 80. If either number is higher than it should be, it’s important to discuss your results with your doctor.<br /><a href='#faq6'>What causes high blood pressure?</a><br />Many things may contribute to high blood pressure, including:<br />Family history.<br />High levels of stress.<br />Obesity.<br />Poor diet with too much salt.<br />Smoking.<br /><a href='#faq7'>How often should blood pressure be checked? </a><br />You should have your blood pressure taken at least once a year. Your doctor can do it at your annual appointment. If your blood pressure is high, ask your doctor how often you should get it checked.<br /><a href='#faq8'>What can you do to prevent high blood pressure or help return your blood pressure to a healthy level? </a><br />To help prevent or control high blood pressure, work with your doctor and take these steps:<br />Avoid tobacco smoke.<br />Eat a healthy diet.<br />Increase your physical activity.<br />Lessen your stress.<br />Limit your alcohol intake.<br />Maintain a healthy weight.<br />Reduce your salt intake.<br />Take medication if prescribed by your doctor.<br />",

We offer safe, comfortable procedures including robotic surgery, which means you can benefit from a shorter recovery time.<br />Your ProMedica hernia surgeon will choose the best type of surgery for your specific hernia. We provide these types of hernia surgery in Toledo and the surrounding area:<br />Open Hernia Repair<br />With this procedure, your surgeon cuts the skin at your groin and pushes the bulging intestine back into your belly. The opening in the muscle wall is then stitched closed. If your muscle wall is weak, your surgeon may use a steel mesh or wire to strengthen the area.<br />Laparoscopic Hernia Repair<br />Your surgeon will make several small incisions in your lower belly, then insert a thin, flexible tube into one of the incisions. The tube, which is called a catheter, has a camera that allows your surgeon to see the area. Other catheters have tiny instruments that your surgeon uses to repair the hernia and use steel mesh, if necessary.<br />Robotic Hernia Repair<br />This type of surgery is also performed with small incisions. The surgeon sits at a console a few feet from the operating table and uses a camera and tiny instruments to repair your hernia. Our Hernia Program is centered on minimally invasive robotic hernia repair, which can shorten your recovery time.<br />",

      "understanding": "<a></a><br />Understand Cholesterol: The Good and the Bad<br />Your body makes all the cholesterol it needs. But foods that come from animal sources, such as meats, dairy products and oils that contain saturated fat, also raise cholesterol levels.<br />Other things that can contribute to unhealthy cholesterol levels include:<br />Age.<br />Excess weight.<br />Family history.<br />Lack of exercise.<br />Tobacco smoke.<br />Cholesterol moves through your bloodstream on proteins known as lipoproteins. There are several types:<br />High-density lipoprotein (HDL): Often called “good cholesterol,” HDL helps your body get rid of excess cholesterol, lowering your risk for heart disease.<br />Low-density lipoprotein (LDL): LDL is the bad cholesterol that causes the most buildup in your arteries. The higher your LDL levels, the greater your risk for cardiovascular disease.<br />Very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL): VLDL is like LDL, carrying a fat called triglycerides. Alcohol and sugar are two major contributors to high triglyceride levels.<br />",
      "prevention": "<a></a><br />Prevention and Treatment<br />Getting Your Cholesterol Checked<br />Since you can have abnormal cholesterol levels without having symptoms, regular cholesterol checks are extremely important. A simple blood test after you fast can provide the information your doctor needs to determine if treatment is needed to ensure your heart health.<br />The American Heart Association recommends adults 20 years and older have their cholesterol checked every four to six years if they’re at low risk. Children should be screened once between the age of 9 and 11 and then again between the ages of 17 and 21.<br />In general, optimal cholesterol levels for a healthy adult are:<br />60 mg/dL or higher for HDL.<br />100 mg/dL or lower for LDL.<br />200 mg/dL or lower for total cholesterol.<br />Your doctor will consider many factors, such as your lifestyle and other health conditions — along with your various cholesterol levels — to weigh your risk for cardiovascular disease and decide if you need treatment.<br />Changing Your Lifestyle<br />While you can’t control factors like your age or family history, there are many lifestyle changes you can make to lower your risk for getting high cholesterol or manage the condition:<br />Drink alcohol in moderation, if you drink at all.<br />Eat a healthy diet. Include fruits, vegetables, whole grains, fish, skinless and lean poultry, nonfat dairy products, beans and nuts. Limit saturated fats, trans fats and salt.<br />Exercise regularly.<br />Quit smoking.<br />In some cases, your doctor may also recommend medication to help you reach healthier cholesterol levels. Talk with your doctor if you have concerns about your cholesterol or to learn more ways to lower your risk of heart disease.<br />",

      "overview": "<a></a><br />Understanding Heart Attacks<br /><a href='#collapse1'>What is a heart attack?</a><br />Think of a heart attack as a plumbing problem. When your arteries are clear, blood flows easily through your body. However, when something interrupts the flow of blood to your heart, it causes heart tissue to die (a heart attack). It can also affect how well your heart pumps in the future.<br />The most common cause of heart attack is coronary artery disease (CAD). With this condition, fatty deposits called plaque build up inside the arteries that supply oxygen-rich blood to your heart muscle.<br />If plaque restricts your blood flow, or part of it breaks off and forms a clot that blocks blood flow, your heart won’t get the oxygen it needs. This can result in chest pain called angina or in a heart attack.<br /><a href='#collapse2'>What are the symptoms of heart attack?</a><br />Identifying heart attack symptoms can be tricky. The sudden, overwhelming symptoms portrayed in movies don’t always happen: They vary from person to person, and between men and women. Being aware of these signs can mean getting help for you or your loved one when every second counts, and can be life-saving:<br />Chest discomfort that can feel like pressure, squeezing, fullness or pain. This can last for several minutes, or go away and come back.<br />Cold sweat, nausea, vomiting or lightheadedness.<br />Shortness of breath, which can happen before or during your chest discomfort.<br />Upper body discomfort in one or both arms or in your back, neck, jaw or stomach.<br />For women, heart attack symptoms often don’t include crushing chest pain or discomfort. Rather, women tend to have discomfort in one or both arms, their back, neck, jaw or stomach.<br />Only 27% of people are aware of the major signs of a heart attack.<br /><a href='#collapse3'>How do I lower my risk for a heart attack?</a><br />Take these healthy steps to strengthen your heart and lower your heart attack risk:<br />Be active: Any physical activity will benefit your heart. Exercise increases blood circulation, improves your energy and helps you manage stress. It also helps control your weight.<br />Control your blood pressure: A normal blood pressure lessens the strain on your heart and minimizes your risk.<br />Eat healthy foods: Load up on fruits, vegetables, whole grains, nuts, lean meats, fish and healthy oils — and bake, broil, poach or grill your foods. Limit red meat, salt, and packaged foods.<br />Know your family history: If you have a family history of CAD or heart attack, you may be at increased risk yourself. Discuss any family history of these conditions with your doctor.<br />Limit your alcohol intake: Consuming alcohol can raise your blood pressure, increase your weight and sometimes cause heart conditions such as irregular heart beat, cardiomyopathy and stroke.<br />Maintain a healthy weight: Excess weight is linked to the hardening of your arteries, which increases your risk for heart attack. Maintaining a healthy diet and weight can decrease your risk.<br />Reduce stress: Ongoing or severe bouts of stress can increase your heart rate, blood pressure and your body’s demand for oxygen — all of which can affect your heart.<br />Stop smoking: You’ll breathe easier. Your food will taste better. You’ll feel better mentally and physically — and you’ll reduce your heart attack risk significantly. Learn more about <a href='/services-and-conditions/tobacco-cessation'>ProMedica’s Stop Smoking Programs.</a><br />Take your heart medication: Staying on schedule with any prescribed heart medications is important. Make sure you’re taking the right dose, at the right times. It’s also a good idea to carry an up-to-date list of all your medications with you, including your prescribed medicines as well as over-the-counter ones you take often.<br />Schedule routine check-ups:  Seeing your primary care provider at least once a year will help you maintain an overall healthy lifestyle and will help identify any potential heart issues.<br />Our compassionate team is ready to support your journey to whole health, whether you are working to prevent a heart condition, lower your risk for heart attack, manage an existing heart condition or heal from a cardiac event. We have everything you need to accomplish your goals and stay healthy.<br /><a href='#collapse4'>How can I help someone with heart attack symptoms?</a><br />Call 911 right away at the first sign of any heart attack symptoms.<br />Though waiting for an ambulance can be stressful, avoid the temptation to drive to the emergency department instead of calling 911. The ambulance will have emergency medical personnel who can provide life-saving treatment at the scene. They can also inform doctors in the emergency department about important details before arrival at the hospital, so they’ll be prepared with the best treatments.<br />While you wait for an ambulance, you can have the symptomatic person chew a regular-strength (325mg) aspirin if you have any available. Aspirin is an anticoagulant and can help prevent blood clots.<br />Call 911 at the first sign of any heart attack symptoms. Don't hesitate. Every second counts.<br /><a href='#collapse5'>What is life like after a heart attack?</a><br />You can go on living a full, active life after a heart attack. And ProMedica will guide you step by step through your journey to find your new normal. You’ll make healthy changes. You’ll be aware of a few limitations. But mostly, you’ll feel great because you’ll be a healthier, happier you after making that commitment to your heart.<br />If you’ve had a heart attack, you may be referred to cardiac rehabilitation to help you recover. A team of experienced professionals will help you develop an individualized care plan.<br /><a href='/services-and-conditions/cardiac-rehab'>Learn more about cardiac rehab.</a><br />",

      "articleContent": "About the Infant Monitor Program<br />Assuring the safe transportation of infants is a requirement at the time of hospital discharge, and consequently, medically fragile and/or premature infants generally undergo a car seat challenge to ensure they are physiologically ready to travel in a rear-facing car seat. Most tested (or challenged) infants will travel home from the hospital in a properly fitted car seat; however, because some infants are unable to maintain a patent airway in the semi-reclined position of a car seat, they must instead travel home in a recumbent car bed. <br />We meet the needs of high-risk infants at <a href='/location/promedica-russell-j-ebeid-childrens-hospital' target='_blank'>ProMedica Russell J. Ebeid Children's Hospital</a> with our diagnostic, therapeutic and educational Infant Monitor Program. We support infants and families whose conditions require the use of home monitoring services. Our pediatric pulmonologists are lung specialists who are board-certified in pediatrics and in pediatric pulmonary medicine with a specialty in intensive care and direct patient care. Our team of physicians, nurses and respiratory therapists follow your baby’s care.<br />Infants referred to the Infant Monitor Program may be:<br />Babies who experience an apparent life-threatening event (ALTE)<br />SIDS siblings<br />Premature infants with apnea / bradycardia<br />Infants with obstructive apnea<br />Babies with seizure / neurological-related apnea<br />Oxygen dependent infants<br />Infants with cardiac problems<br />Infants that initially fail the car seat challenge should undergo an additional car seat challenge prior to transitioning to a traditional, semi-reclined car seat. The Infant Monitor Program staff at <a href='/location/promedica-toledo-hospital'>Toledo </a>and Russell J. Ebeid Children's Hospital's will administer follow-up test on infants that failed their initial Car Seat Challenge Testing prior to discharge. <br />Follow-up out-patient testing is done in Harris McIntosh Tower by a Respiratory Therapist or an RN, when the pediatrician feels it is time to re-test.  A test will take a minimum of 90 minutes. <br />We can be reached by telephone 24 hours a day to answer questions and solve problems related to infant alarms and/or equipment use<br />Contact the Infant Monitor Program at <a href='tel:+14192912229'>419-291-2229</a> or <a href='tel:+18008762763'>800-876-2763</a>.<br />",

      "prevention": "<a></a><br />Risk Factors, Prevention and Screening<br />Although lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths in the United States, the good news is that it’s largely preventable.<br />Also known as lung carcinoma, lung cancer is a malignant lung tumor caused by uncontrollable, abnormal cell growth in one or both of your lungs. These cells, as they keep growing and spreading, keep your lungs from working normally. This growth can also spread beyond your lungs, too, by a process called metastasis.<br />There are five different types of lung cancer. The two most common are non-small cell carcinoma and small cell carcinoma, which make up 96% of all lung cancers.<br />When you know your risk, you can take steps to help prevent the disease and stay on top of any recommended screenings. Early diagnosis is more treatable and could save your life, because treatment may begin before the cancer spreads. According to the American Cancer Society, the 5-year relative survival rate is 61% for non-small cell lung cancer patients and 27% for small cell lung cancer patients if the cancer is detected while it is still in the lungs and hasn’t metastasized beyond the lungs.<br /><a href='#collapse11'>Know Your Risk</a><br />Smoking is the single greatest risk factor for lung cancer. Smoking damages the tissues in your lungs to the point where your body can’t repair itself anymore. Even secondhand smoke is dangerous.<br />Beyond the dangers of smoking, other risk factors can include:<br />A family history of lung cancer.<br />A history of cancer in another part of your body.<br />Being over the age of 50.<br />Exposure to radon, asbestos or other industrial chemicals.<br />Other diseases in the lungs.<br />Previous radiation therapy.<br /><a href='#collapse12'>Take Preventive Measures</a><br />Quitting smoking is the best thing you can do to prevent lung cancer. Quitting at any age can greatly lower your risk for lung cancer.<br />Other ways to prevent lung cancer include:<br /> Be aware of chemical exposure. Talk to your employer about worksite wellness and safety procedures.<br />Have your home tested for radon. Radon is a natural gas in rock, soil and water. It can collect in unsafe levels in any building.<br />Know your family history. If lung cancer runs in your family, talk to your doctor.<br /><a href='/services-and-conditions/tobacco-cessation'>Learn more about Tobacco Cessation.</a><br /><a href='#collapse13'>Stay on Top of Recommended Screenings</a><br />Because lung cancer shows very few signs early on, many people get diagnosed after it’s already progressed. This makes early detection key to survival.<br />A simple, low-dose CT scan to screen for lung cancer takes less than 15 minutes. Talk with your doctor about your lung cancer risk. Together, you can create a screening schedule that’s right for you.<br />Most major insurance plans (including Medicare) cover this screening for people at high risk for lung cancer. You’ll need a doctor's order.<br />Your doctor may recommend a low-dose CT scan if you are age 50-80 who:<br />Currently smokes OR has quit smoking within the last 15 years AND who have a 20 pack-year smoking history.<br />Smoked at least one pack of cigarettes a day for the past 30 years OR smoked at least two packs a day for 15 years.<br />If you would like to schedule a screening, obtain an order from your doctor and call our central scheduling at <a href='tel:419-291-3000'>419-291-3000</a> or <a href='tel:1-800-479-8805'>1-800-479-8805</a>.<br />",

      "articleContent": "About Lymphedema<br />Lymphedema refers to excessive swelling of one or more extremities following damage to the lymphatic system. The lymphatic system is a complicated system in the body that helps to carry fluid, bacteria and harmful substance through a series of lymph nodes that “clean” the fluid.<br />When lymph nodes are damaged or surgically removed, the system can malfunction and lead to excessive and sometimes uncontrollable swelling in the body.

      "articleContent": "<br />About Mammography<br />You know early breast cancer detection is essential. It’s important you feel confident in the screening you receive. Talk with your doctor about digital mammography’s enhanced quality and accuracy.<br />How does a digital mammogram work?<br />As far as your experience, all mammograms are very much alike. You’ll most likely begin regular mammograms between the ages of 35 and 40, younger if there’s a breast cancer history for yourself or your family. Your mammograms are used for both early detection as well as for diagnosis of lumps, breast pain or unusual breast symptoms.<br />During your mammogram, your breast is compressed between two flat surfaces and X-rayed. Digital mammograms display and record the high definition X-ray images on a computer monitor, while a standard film-based mammogram records these images on individual films.<br />What are the benefits of digital mammography?<br />A few solid benefits for you are:<br />Less exposure to radiation compared to a standard film-based mammogram.<br />Reduced need for mammogram re-takes means less time spent for you<br />Higher resolution images and image manipulation for accurate detection and diagnosis<br />Your images are stored in computer files for easy access and sharing amongst experts<br />Is a digital mammogram right for you?<br />This decision is between you and your doctor, but the common perspective is that digital mammography is better suited for you if you:<br />Are under 50 years old<br />Have dense breasts<br />Haven’t been through menopause or have gone through it within the past year<br />Are digital mammograms available at every ProMedica Radiology location?<br />We have many convenient locations with this state-of-the-art technique. <a href='/find-locations/location-results?LocationText=digital%20mammography'>Find one near you.</a><br />",

We’ll be with you every step of the way. That includes everything from your obstetric exams and ultrasounds to the first days of your baby’s life — and everything in between.<br />You’ll have access to:<br />Anesthesiologists.<br />Certified midwives.<br />Childbirth education.<br />Maternal-fetal medicine specialists for high-risk pregnancies.<br />Neonatal services.<br />Obstetric services.<br />Spacious labor, delivery and postpartum rooms.<br />Support groups.<br /><a href='#collapse1'>About Ultrasounds</a><br />Ultrasounds are a safe way to see how your baby is developing and make sure it’s healthy as it grows in your uterus.<br />Also called sonography, an obstetric ultrasound uses high-frequency sound waves sent into your body from a scanning instrument placed on your skin. The sound waves reflect off bones and tissues and are analyzed by a computer. This results in an image.<br />Along with a standard ultrasound, your doctor may want you to have a Doppler ultrasound. It evaluates organ and fetal vessel blood flow. In some cases, you may need a vaginal ultrasound to provide more information.<br />A typical ultrasound takes between 30 and 60 minutes. You don’t need to make special preparations, but you may want to wear loose-fitting clothes that can be washed, since a gel-like material is used on your abdomen.<br />Some doctor’s offices limit the number of people who can come to your appointment. Usually one adult is welcome to watch your ultrasound with you. Sometimes when the ultrasound is almost over, your doctor will allow other adults to join you in the room.<br />A detailed report is always sent to your obstetric care provider after the ultrasound. It will help your doctor learn:<br />If there are any potential birth defects.<br />Whether your baby is growing at a suitable rate.<br />How much fluid is around your baby.<br />The measurement of your cervical length.<br />Your baby’s due date.<br />Your baby’s position in the womb.<br /><a href='#collapse2'>About C-Sections</a><br />A C-section, also called cesarean delivery, is a type of surgery. Your baby is delivered through incisions (cuts) in your abdomen and uterus, instead of a vaginal birth.<br />You can schedule your C-section ahead of time if you begin to have pregnancy complications or you've had a past C-section and don’t plan to have vaginal birth after cesarean (VBAC). But for first-time moms, the need for a C-section often isn’t clear until labor has started.<br />Stalled labor is one of the main reasons why your doctor might recommend a C-section. Other reasons include:<br />A problem with your placenta.<br />You or your baby have a health concern that makes vaginal delivery risky.<br />You’re carrying twins, triplets or other multiples.<br />Your baby is not in a normal position.<br />Your baby is not getting enough oxygen.<br /><a href='#collapse3'>About High-Risk Pregnancies</a><br />Your pregnancy may be considered high-risk because of a health condition you had before pregnancy or a health condition that develops during pregnancy. If so, ProMedica’s maternal-fetal medicine specialists are ready with the care you and your baby need.<br /><a href='/services-and-conditions/maternal-fetal-medicine-high-risk-pregnancy'>Learn more about high-risk pregnancy care.</a><br />",

Do you prefer a certain room size? Will your partner be staying the night?<br />Location: You may prefer a location close to your home so you can get to the hospital faster when labor begins.<br />Tours: Visit several hospitals before you make a decision. Take your partner, mother or a trusted friend. This will help you think about which hospital best fits your needs and makes you as comfortable as possible when it’s time to deliver.<br /><a href='#collapse13'>Know the Signs and Stages of Labor</a><br />After nine months of waiting, you’ll be ready for the big day. When you have these signs of labor, call your doctor and family members:<br />Contractions: Contractions are the shortening of your uterine muscles. They happen before and during childbirth. When they occur less than 10 minutes apart, that usually means labor has started. It’s not unusual to have periodic, irregular contractions as your labor nears.<br />Your water breaks: The amniotic sac surrounds and protects your unborn baby. When fluid leaks from your vagina, it means the membranes of the sac have ruptured. This can happen hours before labor starts or during labor. Most women go into labor within 24 hours after their water breaks.<br />It will also help to recognize the stages of labor:<br />Stage one: The first stage of labor includes latent, active and transition phases. To help your cervix dilate, your contractions will come more and more often until you’re completely dilated (10 centimeters).<br />Stage two: Stage two begins when the cervix is completely opened. At this point, your doctor will tell you to push. Pushing, along with your contractions, propels your baby through the birth canal. Your baby’s head will crown, and you’ll keep pushing to deliver your baby’s shoulders and body. Once your baby is fully delivered, the umbilical cord is clamped and cut.<br />Stage three: In the final stage of labor, you’ll deliver the placenta, the organ that nourishes your baby inside your womb.<br /><a href='#collapse14'>Pack Your Bag for the Hospital</a><br />Pack a bag for your hospital stay ahead of time. Include any paperwork you may need, your birth plan, comfy clothes, personal hygiene items and any items that may help you pass the time as you wait.<br />You may also want to pack items for your baby. Include clothing for pictures and your ride home. And don’t forget the car seat.<br /><a href='#collapse15'>Prepare for a C-Section, Just in Case</a><br />Whether you’re having a planned C-section or will only have one if it becomes necessary during labor, a little advance preparation will go a long way to ease your anxiety. Planning will also help make sure your C-section goes as smoothly as possible. This planning includes talking to your doctor about anesthesia choices ahead of time to decide on the best one for you if it’s needed. You may also be asked to take blood tests in case an emergency blood transfusion is needed during delivery.<br />Also, plan for your at-home recovery by asking for help from friends, family or a nanny.<br />Some of the ways that a C-section differs from vaginal birth include:<br />Abdominal incision: The doctor will make an incision through your abdominal wall, usually horizontally near your pubic hairline.<br />Anesthesia: Anesthesia is used to numb the lower part of your body, which allows you to stay awake during the C-section.<br />Bathing: For a scheduled C-section, you’ll be asked to shower or bathe the night before with antibacterial soap. This lowers the risk of infection. Your abdomen will be cleaned again at the hospital before your procedure. A tube will be inserted to collect your urine.<br />IV: An IV will be inserted in your hand or arm to deliver fluids and medicine.<br />Uterine incision: After your abdominal incision, the doctor will make an incision in your uterus. The uterine incision is usually horizontal across the lower part of your uterus.<br /><a href='#collapse16'>Understand How to Manage Your Pain During Childbirth</a><br />You may learn special ways to breathe in childbirth classes or choose to have pain medicine for labor. Pain-relieving drugs for labor have two categories: analgesics and anesthetics. Talk to your doctor about the best pain treatment medicine for you.<br />",
      "after": "<a></a><br />After Delivery<br />Postpartum Care and Recovery<br />Pregnancy and childbirth put your body through a lot. After you give birth (postpartum), it’s vital that you rest as much as you can to make sure you get back to good health.<br />Slowly ease back into your daily routine. Ask family and friends for help with meals and babysitting so you can rest.<br /><a href='#collapse21'>Know About C-Section Recovery</a><br />C-section recovery takes longer than recovering from vaginal birth. C-sections also come with specific risks to you and your baby.<br />Risks to your baby include breathing problems such as transient tachypnea or surgical injuries such as nicks to your baby’s skin. These risks are rare.<br />A C-section can put you at risk for:<br />Blood clots.<br />Increased bleeding.<br />Increased risks during future pregnancies.<br />Inflammation and infection of the membrane lining your uterus.<br />Reactions to anesthesia.<br />Surgical injury.<br />Wound infection.<br /><a href='#collapse22'>Maintain Your Health After Giving Birth</a><br />Just as it was important to take care of yourself during pregnancy, you should also protect your health as you recover. There are a few easy steps you can take to make sure you have the best, and fastest, recovery.<br />Avoid sex if you’ve had a C-section: It’s usually safe to have sex again about four to six weeks after surgery or after your doctor gives you the go-ahead.<br />Drink plenty of fluids: Drinking water and other fluids will help replace the fluid you lost during delivery and will lose when you’re breastfeeding. Fluids also help keep you from getting constipated.<br />Eat well: Eat foods with plenty of vitamins and minerals to restore your body and build strength.<br />Take it easy: Rest often and try to keep everything you or your baby will need within your reach. Avoid lifting from a squatting position or lifting anything heavier than your baby for the first few weeks.<br />Take your medication: Your doctor might recommend Tylenol or other medicines to relieve pain. Ask your doctor which pain relief medicines are safe for women who are breastfeeding.<br /><a href='#collapse23'>Recognize Post-Delivery Complications</a><br />These signs point to a post-delivery problem. Call your doctor right away if you have:<br />Bleeding that soaks a sanitary napkin within an hour or contains large clots.<br />Breast pain along with redness or fever.<br />Bad-smelling vaginal discharge.<br />Leg pain or swelling.<br />Painful urination.<br />Signs of infection, such as a fever higher than 100.4° F, severe pain in your abdomen, or redness, swelling and discharge at your C-section incision site.<br /><a href='#collapse24'>Watch Out for Postpartum Warning Signs</a><br />Postpartum depression is a common problem with pregnancy and delivery, and it can affect anyone. Ranging from moderate to severe, this form of depression can happen as soon as your baby is born or anytime up to one year after delivery.<br />Signs include:<br />Trouble bonding with your baby.<br />Lack of joy in life.<br />Loss of appetite.<br />Loss of interest in sex.<br />Overwhelming fatigue.<br />Severe mood swings.<br />Withdrawal from family and friends.<br />Often, these symptoms naturally lessen over time. However, if not recognized or managed well, postpartum depression can become quite serious. Call your doctor right away if you have any of the signs. We can help ease your symptoms and keep you safe.<br />",

      "diagnosis": "<a></a><br />Diagnosing Migraines<br />A migraine headache is an intense throbbing or pulsing in one area of your head. Migraines sometimes include nausea, vomiting and extreme sensitivity to both light and sound. Often, migraines will have sensory warning symptoms, which include:<br />Blind spots.<br />Flashes of light.<br />Tingling in your arm or leg.<br />Get a Thorough Examination and Accurate Diagnosis<br />Just as there are a number of conditions that could be causing your headache pain, there are a number of diagnostic tools to help us get a clear picture of what’s happening. After gathering your complete medical history and performing a physical, your healthcare provider will help you decide which tests are needed to help diagnose your condition.<br />Common diagnostic procedures include:<br />Blood tests: These tests are often done to check for other underlying conditions.<br />Computed tomography scan (CT or CAT scan): A CT scan combines X-rays and computer technology to produce images of the body. These images can show detailed parts of the body, including bones, muscles, fat and organs. CT scans are more detailed than standard X-rays.<br />Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI): An MRI combines large magnets, radiofrequencies and a computer to produce detailed images of organs and structures within the body.<br />Sinus X-rays: X-ray imaging can find congestion or other problems that may be corrected.<br /> Spinal tap (lumbar puncture): With a spinal tap, a special needle is placed into the spinal canal within the lower back. It measures pressure in the spinal canal and brain. A small amount of cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) is removed and tested to learn if you have an infection or other problems.<br />",

      "articleContent": "<br />Understanding MRI<br />In order to diagnose a disease or confirm your treatment’s effectiveness, your doctor sometimes needs high-resolution images of your organs or other parts of your body. To get these images, your doctor may order an MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) scan.<br />How does MRI work?<br />MRI is a technique that uses radio waves and a magnetic field to gather these necessary images. During an MRI, you’ll lie inside an MRI machine (in most cases). It’s here that the magnetic field inside the machine will re-align itself with your body and, paired with radio waves, will give off faint signals.<br />Your radiology technician or nurse will record the signals and images and report them to your radiologist who, in turn, will interpret the findings. These findings help with diagnosis and treatment recommendations.<br />Where do you go for your MRI?<br />Choose from our many radiology centers offering MRI, as well as a variety of other <a href='/services-and-conditions/radiology'>radiology </a>services.<br />",

      "articleContent": "<br />About Multiple Sclerosis<br />Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a disease in which your immune system attacks myelin, the covering that protects your nerves. This damage to the myelin disrupts information flow both within your brain and between your brain and the rest of your body. These nerves deteriorate, which is an irreversible condition. MS is a degenerative disease, meaning the symptoms will get progressively worse over time.<br />MS Symptoms<br />People with multiple sclerosis usually have their first symptoms between the ages of 20 and 40. Signs and symptoms vary depending on the extent of nerve damage and which nerves are affected. Some Multiple Sclerosis symptoms include:<br />Blurred vision<br />Loss of balance<br />Poor coordination<br />Slurred speech<br />Tremors<br />Numbness<br />Extreme fatigue<br />Problems with memory and concentration<br />Paralysis<br />Blindness<br />MS Flare-Ups<br />You can go days or years without major changes in your symptoms and then suddenly experience a “flare up,” or relapse. MS is active again when you develop new MS symptoms, a regular problem gets worse, or your symptoms last 24 hours or longer.<br />Causes of Multiple Sclerosis<br />The cause of MS is currently unknown, but childhood infections and genetics are believed to play a role.There’s no cure, but there are ways to control your symptoms. Since prolonged over-exertion and stress may be contributing factors to flare ups, exercise, regular stretching, and relaxation may help you manage MS symptoms. Talk to your primary physician or neurologist, who may recommend treatments such as physical therapy, muscle relaxants, or medications to reduce fatigue or other symptoms.<br />",

They care for premature babies as early as 22 weeks’ gestation and as small as 400 grams (14 oz). Learn more about the services we provide to patients, as well as healthcare professionals and our community.<br /><a href='#collapse11'>Education</a><br />Our NICU is a clinical training facility for:<br />Medical students and pediatric residents from The University of Toledo Health Science Campus.<br />Neonatal nurse practitioners.<br />Physician assistants.<br />Nurses.<br />Respiratory therapists.<br />Emergency medical technicians (EMTs).<br />Paramedic students.<br />They all work under the close supervision of the neonatologists, neonatal nurse practitioners, nurses and respiratory therapists. You may see many of these trainees helping with daily care for your baby.<br /><a href='#collapse12'>Research</a><br />Our NICU takes an active part in multiple research initiatives to advance the field of neonatal medicine. Our goal is to provide the highest-quality care to your baby and to future babies. You may be asked by a research associate if you’d like to join a study. All studies have been approved by the ProMedica Pediatric Institutional Review Board. This regulatory body makes sure the patients in research studies are safe and protected.<br />If you agree to take part in a study, you’ll be asked to sign a consent form that details the study and all the benefits and risks that come with participating. Keep in mind that you don’t have to join a study. Your baby will still receive the best possible care even if you choose not to participate. Please talk with your doctor if you have any questions about taking part in a research study.<br /><a href='#collapse13'>Simulation Training</a><br />Members of the NICU team receive simulation training on life-like premature and newborn mannequins. These high-fidelity mannequins simulate neonatal heart and lung functions and can be programmed to simulate infant emergencies. Simulation scenarios include high-risk, high stress situations and allow trainees to make mistakes and learn from them in a safe setting.<br />This practice environment helps our 'team of experts' become an 'expert team' and enhances overall patient safety.<br /><a href='#collapse14'>Transportation </a><br />We are a regional referral center. Every year, approximately 350 babies are transported in and out of our NICU. We have a dedicated, highly skilled transport team comprised of nurses and respiratory therapists. We serve over 25 hospitals across 27 counties in northwest Ohio and southeast Michigan and utilize both air and ground transportation. The transport team provides specialized neonatal care from the moment they pick up a baby at the referring hospital until they arrive at our NICU.<br /><a href='#collapse15'>Ventilation</a><br />Our team uses a range of ventilatory support. To meet the specific needs of critically ill newborns, the team relies on conventional ventilation, non-invasive ventilation, high frequency ventilation, nitric oxide and neurally adjusted ventilator assist (NAVA).<br />NAVA is a progressive mechanical ventilation method that’s controlled by a patient’s brain. This technology provides synchronized breathing support for your baby and may help reduce lifelong damage to the lungs.<br />As one of the first users of NAVA in newborns in the world, we’ve treated more than 1200 infants. That’s more than the rest of the world combined. Doctors at our hospital also helped to develop the worldwide management strategies and clinical guidelines for using NAVA in newborns.<br />",

      "articleContent": "Understanding Nuclear Medicine<br />Nuclear medicine is used to determine how an organ is functioning. For example, nuclear medicine can be used to study how a damaged heart is functioning or how blood flow is restricted in parts of the brain. Other organs that can be imaged using nuclear medicine include the liver, kidneys, thyroid, bones, and many others.<br />During a nuclear medicine study, chemicals 'tagged' with radionuclides that emit gamma rays are injected into the body. The chemicals collect in the area of the body that is to be studied. Images, which may be taken immediately or days after the injection, are obtained by using a gamma camera that detects the gamma rays and produces an image map called a scintigram.<br />Nuclear medicine studies provide information that can help your doctor diagnose and treat diseases in their early stages. Nuclear medicine, using radioactive substances, can also be used to treat certain diseases and conditions, such as overactive thyroid glands or thyroid tumors.<br />Preparing for a Nuclear Medicine Study<br />Generally, there are no special preparations that need to be made prior to having a nuclear medicine study. However, certain types of studies may require some preparation. For example, prior to having a thyroid uptake and scan, your doctor may ask that you avoid foods and medications with iodine for one week prior to the test. Your doctor or radiologist can advise you about any special instructions you may need to follow.<br />",

      "articleContent": "Understanding Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder<br />Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a condition where one experiences unreasonable fearful thoughts and performs ritualistic activities in order to manage those thoughts.<br />The frequent disturbing thoughts or images are referred to as obsessions. The repetitive rituals performed to try and dispel the obsessions are called compulsions. For example: mealtimes, bath, bedtime, and exercise are all positive routine activities. However, OCD rituals are so frequent and intense that they can interfere with your daily life.<br />The following are examples of obsessions:<br />Aggressive impulses, thoughts and/or behaviors<br />Counting, thinking about numbers and sequences for long periods of time<br />Excessive fear of something terrible happening<br />Extreme attention to detail<br />Intense preoccupation with dirt and germs<br />Persistent thoughts of performing extremely distasteful sexual acts<br />Preoccupation with perfection, symmetry or order<br />Preoccupation with remembering trivial things<br />Repeated doubts (for example, did I lock the door?)<br />Thoughts about violence towards someone else or their self<br />Thoughts conflicting with religious beliefs<br />The following are examples of compulsions:<br />Asking the same question repeatedly<br />Constant checking and rechecking (for example, checking if a door is locked)<br />Excessive counting, recounting and/or grouping<br />Hoarding objects<br />Repeated obscene words or gestures<br />Repeated words, sounds, numbers, and/or music to self<br />Repeated hand-washing (often more than 100 times a day)<br />Repeated words spoken by self or others<br />Causes<br />The exact cause is unknown, but research suggests that it’s a neurological brain disorder caused by a deficiency of the chemical, serotonin, in the brain. OCD tends to run in families.<br />OCD in Children and Adolescents<br />If you believe your child has OCD, contact your pediatrician to set up an appointment for evaluation. If further assessment is needed, your pediatrician may recommend evaluation by a licensed behavioral health professional. OCD can be effectively treated, usually with a combination of individual therapy and medication.<br />",

During the procedure, surgeons reconstruct ligaments or cartilage and remove loose bone or cartilage from the knee, shoulder, elbow, ankle, hip or wrist.<br /><a href='#collapse2'>Hip Replacement Surgery</a><br />Hip replacement surgery allows your surgeon to replace damaged parts of your hip joint with new parts made of metal alloys, high-grade plastics and polymers. Hip replacement choices include:<br />Total hip replacement: removes part of the thigh bone, including the ball (the top), and replaces it with a new, smaller artificial ball.<br />Anterior approach hip replacement: a minimally invasive surgical method that’s done from the front of the hip. It may result in earlier and easier recovery, less pain and unrestricted movement after surgery.<br />Resurfacing: a procedure for younger patients in which the damaged joint is repaired with a cap placed over the ball of the thigh bone. A matching cup is mounted into the hip socket.<br /><a href='#collapse3'>Knee Replacement Surgery</a><br />An artificial knee replacement allows your surgeon to replace damaged parts of your knee with artificial parts made of metal alloys, high-grade plastics and polymers.<br /><a href='#collapse4'>Rotator Cuff Repairs</a><br />Rotator cuff repair surgery can help restore the function and flexibility of your shoulder and relieve pain that can’t be controlled by other treatments.<br /><a href='#collapse5'>Spine surgery</a><br />Spine surgery is a delicate process. It can require extensive entry to repair a curved spine or a minimal incision to repair a herniated disc. Conditions of the spine that often require surgery include:<br />Herniated or bulging disc.<br />Broken vertebrae.<br />Spinal fusion.<br />Deformity surgery (like correcting spine curvatures caused by scoliosis).<br />",
      "beforeAfter": "",
      "before": "<a></a><br />Preparing for Your Orthopaedic Procedure<br /><a href='#collapse11'>What to Expect at Your First Appointment</a><br />At your initial orthopaedic consultation, your doctor will talk with you about the best ways to treat your bone, joint or muscle pain.<br />Be prepared to share your health history and any current health conditions. This is also the time to ask your doctor any questions you have, including:<br />Are tests or other medical evaluations needed first? How, when and where do I get them?<br />Are there any dietary restrictions before or after surgery?<br />Do I need to bring someone with me to the procedure?<br />What are the benefits and risks of this procedure?<br />What are the possible complications and how likely are they to happen?<br />What should I expect after treatment? How long will it take to recover?<br /><a href='#collapse12'>Orthopaedic Diagnostic Tests</a><br />To diagnose your possible bone, joint or muscle condition, your orthopaedic provider will examine your range of motion and do a physical exam to check for:<br />Growths or cysts around joints.<br />Misalignment in your skeleton.<br />Muscles that are not equal on both sides of your body.<br />Swollen joints.<br />Along with the physical range of motion and flexibility exam, your doctor may order other tests which could include:<br />Blood tests to pinpoint conditions like rheumatoid arthritis, cancer and other health concerns.<br />Bone scans to measure how much bone tissue needs to be removed or replaced.<br />Computed tomography scans (CT or CAT scans) to produce detailed images of your body.<br />Gait analysis to spot abnormalities in your body structure, see how your limbs align and check your joint rotation.<br />Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to create pictures of what’s happening inside your body.<br />Reflex response to assess how quickly your joints and brain respond to stimulus.<br />X-rays to check for fractures or tumors.<br /><a href='#collapse13'>Preparing for Recovery</a><br />Once your procedure is scheduled, our team will talk with you about how to proactively prepare for recovery. This will include health and wellness guidelines, as well as ways to make sure your home is set up for healing.<br />Preparing Your Body for Recovery<br />You can lower your risk of complications by being in the best possible health before your procedure.<br />Eat healthy, nutritious foods.<br />Exercise safely to improve fitness.<br />Stay at a healthy weight.<br />Manage sleep apnea.<br />Get help for depression.<br />Setting Your Home Up For Recovery<br />During recovery, you may not be able to move around as much as usual. Think through your daily routines and make sure you have the support and resources you need to recover safely and fully heal.<br />Arrange for help with household chores.<br />Be aware of medicines that make you sleepy, dizzy or lightheaded.<br />Follow the recommended exercises to have more strength and better balance.<br />Make a plan about what to do if you fall.<br />Make sure your bed is low enough.<br />Move a bed to the first floor to avoid climbing stairs.<br />Remove any loose objects or carpeting from the stairs.<br />Bathroom Safety Tips<br />Bathing is one of the trickiest tasks you’ll tackle after surgery. You can make showering after the procedure easier and safer by being ready ahead of time. Try these tips for your bathroom:<br />Get a bath chair or bench to use in the shower.<br />Install safety bars — one to help you get in and out of the tub and another to help you stand from a sitting position.<br />Place nonslip suction mats or rubber silicone decals inside and outside the bath.<br />",

We can also help you purchase the Lifeline Medical Alarm Service.<br /><a href='#collapse22'>Pain Management</a><br />Pain relief after surgery helps you build the strength and confidence you need to heal. Our multidisciplinary approach to pain management begins with the most up-to-date anesthesia methods.<br />Post-surgery, your pain management plan may include in-office procedures, physical and aquatic therapy and medicine.

After a joint replacement, our licensed physical therapists evaluate and treat you so you can maximize your skills and abilities. Their goal is to coordinate a plan of care that will help you recover with the best possible outcome.<br />Once you’ve recovered from your surgery, you may need to have physical therapy in an outpatient setting. We offer therapy at more than 20 convenient locations in northwest Ohio and southwest Michigan.<br /><a href='/find-locations/'>Find a ProMedica Total Rehab location near you.</a><br /><a href='#collapse24'>Swing Bed Program</a><br />If you’re recovering from a major surgery such as total joint replacement, you may benefit from our swing bed program. It’s called a swing bed because your care “swings” from traditional hospital care to skilled nursing care. It allows you to stay at the hospital, rather than transferring to a nursing center. Your care team can help you decide if the swing bed program is right for you.<br /><a href='#collapse25'>Wound Care</a><br />Your surgical team will give you detailed instructions to care for your incision (cut) site safely. Once you’re at home, call your doctor right away if you notice:<br />A temperature above 100°F for more than four hours.<br />An increase in the wound size.<br />Bleeding.<br />More drainage or the wound turns green or yellow or smells bad.<br />More pain, redness or swelling.<br /><a href='/services-and-conditions/wound-care'>Learn more about wound care.</a><br />",

Let our experts at ProMedica Total Rehab help you relieve your joint pain.<br />Have you noticed mild swelling around your joints?<br />Do you feel as though your joint pain is worse after activity or towards the end of the day?<br />Have you heard a clicking or cracking sound when a joint bends?<br />What is osteoarthritis?<br />Osteoarthritis is the most common form of arthritis. It occurs when the cartilage in a joint breaks down due to “wear and tear” over time. This can result from overuse during a job or athletic activities. When the cartilage is damaged or gone completely, moving a joint can cause pain and friction between joints.<br />Can osteoarthritis be treated?<br />If you have osteoarthritis, talk to your doctor about treatment options. With a prescription from your physician, <a href='/services-and-conditions/physical-therapy'>physical</a> and <a href='/services-and-conditions/occupational-therapy'>occupational therapy</a> can be an effective method of treatment.

      "articleContent": "<br />About Osteoporosis and Other Bone Conditions<br />You know you need to take care of your bones. But your lifestyle choices, illness, and occupation can take a toll. Learn about common bone conditions.<br />Osteoporosis FAQ<br /><a href='#faq1'>What is osteoporosis?</a><br />Osteoporosis is the thinning of bone tissue and loss of bone density, most often experienced by women, over time. Osteoporosis affects close to 32 million American women over 50, and nearly 2 million men between 50 and 70 years old.<br /><a href='#faq2'>How does osteoporosis affect you?</a><br />As osteoporosis progresses, the bones become more and more brittle. Thinner bones lead to fractures and broken bones, and thin bones are harder to heal. In extreme cases, your bones can be so fragile that bumping into a piece of furniture can cause a fracture. Osteoporosis can also decrease your height and put stress on your back.<br /><a href='#faq6'>What causes osteoporosis?</a><br /><a href='/services-and-conditions/menopause'>Menopause</a> is one of the primary causes of osteoporosis in women. The female hormone estrogen protects women’s bones. During menopause this hormone decreases sharply. Some women lose up to 20 percent of their bone mass during menopause.<br />But men with certain conditions are at risk too. <a href='/services-and-conditions/cystic-fibrosis'>Cystic fibrosis</a>, asthma, low testosterone levels, and <a href='/services-and-conditions/chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease'>chronic obstructive pulmonary disease</a> can all lead to osteoporosis in men. Alcohol abuse and tobacco usage lead to significant damage to your bones, for both men and women.<br /><a href='#faq7'>Are you at risk?</a><br />If you answer yes to any of the following questions, talk to your doctor about a bone density test.<br />Are you over the age of 65?<br />Do you have a history of bone fractures as an adult or do you have a close relative with a history of bone fractures?<br />Do you have a family history of osteoporosis?<br />Did you have an early menopause or removal of your ovaries?<br />Do you smoke?<br />Do you have a small-boned, thin body frame?<br />Are you physically inactive?<br />Are calcium-rich foods, like dairy or leafy green vegetables, limited in your diet? Have you been told you're vitamin D deficient?<br />Do you consume alcohol on a regular basis?<br />Are you on certain medicines, such as steroids or anticonvulsants?<br /><a href='#faq8'>How can you prevent osteoporosis?</a><br />Regular exercise and a diet rich in calcium and Vitamin D strengthen your bones and prevent damage from osteoporosis. If you’re over the age of 50, you should get 1,500 milligrams of calcium and 1,000 milligrams of Vitamin D daily. Foods like eggs, cheese, low-fat milk, fish, and leafy vegetables are good sources of both calcium and Vitamin D. Spending 20 to 25 minutes in the sun is also a beneficial way to get Vitamin D.<br />Ask your doctor about an osteoporosis bone screening to detect osteoporosis early.<br />The most common test is the dual X-ray absorptiometry <a href='/services-and-conditions/dexa-scan'>(DXA or DEXA) test</a>. This measures your bone density using X-ray imagery.<br />What are some other bone conditions?<br />Acromegaly: Excess growth hormone production causes bones in the face, hand, and feet to grow too large.<br /><a href='/services-and-conditions/cancer/'>Cancer:</a> Common bone cancers include leukemia, osteosarcoma, Ewing sarcoma, malignant fibrous histiocytoma, and chondrosarcoma.<br />Fibrous Dysplasia: Swelling and abnormal growth of bones of the skull, face, ribs, upper arms, pelvis, thighs, and shins.<br />Heel spurs: Calcium deposits that form on the base of the heel bone.<br />Osteogenesis Imperfecta: A genetic disorder that interrupts the production of collagen, which weakens your bones.<br />Osteomalacia: Weak and abnormal bones caused by a defect in the way your body processes vitamin D.<br />Osteomyelitis: A bacterial infection of bone requiring antibiotics and sometimes surgery.<br />Paget's Disease: Thick and enlarged, but brittle, bones caused by a malfunction in the cells that repair your bones.<br />Perthes' Disease: The head of a child’s femur (thigh bone) deteriorates because of a lack of blood supply.<br />Rickets: Weak and easily fractured bones in children due to a lack of vitamin D.<br />",

While it traditionally was considered to affect the motor system, it is now recognized to have a range of clinical features. In addition to movement problems, there may also be neuropsychiatric and non-motor symptoms. The exact cause of Parkinson's disease is not always clear but many symptoms are thought to result from a lack of dopamine (chemical that is responsible for transmitting signals in between the nerve cells (neurons) of the brain).<br />The key motor features of Parkinson's disease are:<br />Tremor that typically occurs at rest and may have a 'pill rolling' appearance<br />Stiffness or rigidity of the limbs and trunk<br />Generalized slowness of movement (bradykinesia)<br />Inability to keep body in stable or balance position<br />Gait difficulty<br />",

This recognition puts us in the company of fewer than a dozen organizations in the United States to achieve this certification. We meet the highest national standards for quality and safety in asthma diagnosis, treatment and education.<br />Childhood asthma in Lucas County is widespread. It affects 5% of children under the age of five, 15% of children under the age of 11, and 21% of children in grades 6 through 12. Of children diagnosed with asthma, 32% are African American.<br />At ProMedica Ebeid Children’s Hospital, the goal of our asthma program is to help minimize the frequency and severity of a child’s symptoms. Working directly with affected children and their families, we help them understand and manage their condition. This reduces their risk for emergency room and hospital visits, and improves quality of life. Our patient care program offers a wide spectrum of services and support, including:<br />Controller medicines to decrease symptoms and prevent asthma attacks.<br />Education on personal asthma triggers, such as allergies, smoke, exercise and cold air.<br />How to understand the differences among medicines and how to take the right one at the right time.<br />Personalized Asthma Action Plans to help monitor and manage symptoms and document key healthcare contacts.

      "causes": "<a></a><br />Understanding Chronic Pelvic Pain<br />Chronic pelvic pain is discomfort in the lower abdomen (below the belly button) that lasts for at least six months. There are many different conditions that can cause chronic pelvic pain. And symptoms can vary widely from person to person — from pain that comes and goes to severe and steady pain.<br />Just as each person is unique, so is each case. While some describe chronic pelvic pain as a dull ache or heaviness in the pelvis, others have cramping and sharper bouts of pain. Whatever your experience is, when your pain causes you to miss work and lose sleep or avoid activities you love, it’s time to get medical attention.<br />Working with a pelvic health specialist, you can pinpoint the source of your pain and come up with a care plan that offers relief.<br />1 in 3 women of childbearing age have chronic pelvic pain.<br />Causes of Chronic Pelvic Pain<br /><a href='#collapse1'>Endometriosis</a><br />Endometriosis happens when tissue that normally grows inside your uterus, grows on the outside. While we still don’t know the exact cause, we know its risk factors. These include:<br />A family history of endometriosis (blood relative).<br />Any condition that prevents normal menstrual flow.<br />Going through menopause at an older age.<br />Higher levels of estrogen in the body.<br />Heavy periods that last longer than seven days.<br />Low body mass index.<br />Never giving birth.<br />Reproductive tract problems.<br />Short menstrual cycles (less than 27 days).<br />Starting your period at an early age.<br />We’ve also been able to pinpoint common symptoms; the most telling seem to be chronic pelvic pain, painful intercourse or difficult periods.<br />Endometriosis is usually diagnosed after your doctor does a pelvic exam. You may also need to have an ultrasound or MRI. In some cases, your doctor may use minimally invasive surgery (laparoscopy) to check for signs of endometriosis.<br />Treatment for endometriosis can include pain medicine, hormone therapy or surgery. The type of treatment you receive will depend on your symptoms and whether you want to have children. Your doctor will work with you to decide on the best treatment for your needs.<br /><a href='#collapse2'>Pelvic Congestion Syndrome</a><br />Veins that are weak can cause blood to build up, and this pooling can lead to varicose veins. When varicose veins develop in your pelvis and cause chronic pelvic pain, we call it pelvic congestion syndrome.<br />This syndrome usually affects women of childbearing age, women who’ve had two or more pregnancies or women with a family history of vein problems.<br />The main symptom of pelvic congestion syndrome is chronic pelvic pain, but you also could have an urge to urinate more often, develop hemorrhoids or notice varicose veins on the outside of your genitals or on your inner thighs.<br />If your doctor thinks you have pelvic congestion syndrome, you’ll have a physical exam. Then you may need to have an ultrasound or CT scan to confirm the diagnosis.<br />Treatment usually involves taking hormone medicines, and sometimes minimally invasive surgery.<br /><a href='/services-and-conditions/pelvic-congestion-syndrome'>Learn more about pelvic congestion syndrome</a>.<br /><a href='#collapse3'>Pelvic Floor Disorders</a><br />The muscles, ligaments and nerves at the bottom of your pelvis make up what we call “your pelvic floor.” You may have a pelvic floor disorder if you notice changes in your normal habits. These changes include trouble urinating, urine or feces that leak out or sudden pelvic fullness or pain.<br />If your doctor suspects you have a pelvic floor disorder, a physical exam alone can often confirm your diagnosis. But, if your doctor needs a clearer picture of your pelvic health, more imaging tests may be requested.<br />Treatment for pelvic floor disorders can vary based on your unique condition, but it will often include behavioral therapy, physical therapy or medicines. Surgery may also be recommended in some cases.<br /><a href='/services-and-conditions/pelvic-floor-disorders'>Learn more about pelvic floor disorders. </a><br /><a href='#collapse4'>Uterine Fibroids</a><br />Uterine fibroids are noncancerous growths that form in the muscles of the uterus. They can be as small as a pea or as large as an orange or cantaloupe.<br />Fibroids are more likely to affect women with a family history of the condition. However, obese women, African American women and women who started puberty early are also at higher risk.<br />While many women have no symptoms, others may experience:<br />Frequent urination.<br />Heavy bleeding between or during periods that includes blood clots.<br />Increased menstrual cramping.<br />Menstruation that lasts longer than usual.<br />Pain during intercourse.<br />Pain in the pelvis or lower back.<br />Pressure or fullness in the lower abdomen.<br />Swelling in the abdomen.<br />Uterine fibroids are usually diagnosed with a pelvic exam. Your doctor may also want you to have imaging tests, such as an ultrasound or MRI. These tests can offer a clearer picture of your pelvic health and confirm your diagnosis.<br />Treatment for uterine fibroids may include hormone therapy, changes to your diet and in some cases, minimally invasive surgery.<br /><a href='#collapse5'>Other Conditions </a><br />If you’re living with chronic pelvic pain, the usual reasons for that are endometriosis, pelvic floor disorders and uterine fibroids. However, other conditions can cause chronic pelvic pain, including:<br />Abdominal myofascial pain happens when muscles in the abdominal wall, pelvic floor or lower back don’t work properly. Sometimes, these muscles are too sensitive or contract too much. Women who have this condition often have small areas in the pelvis (trigger points) that feel tender.<br />Cancers of the reproductive organs include cancer in the cervix, ovaries, uterus, vagina or vulva. If your doctor believes cancer is causing your pelvic pain, he or she will refer you to a gynecologist-oncologist.<br />Interstitial cystitis happens when the bladder becomes inflamed, often causing urinary incontinence. If your doctor believes you have this condition, he or she will refer you to a urogynecologist or a urologist.<br />Musculoskeletal problems affect your bones, joints and connective tissue, causing fibromyalgia, pelvic floor muscle tension, inflammation of the pubic joint and hernias.<br />Psychological factors, such as depression, chronic stress and a history of abuse, can sometimes cause pelvic pain.<br />Talk to an expert: Call <a href='tel:567-585-0240'>567-585-0240</a> to make an appointment.<br />",

ProMedica’s board-certified doctors specialize in treating pelvic pain and have spent years helping women overcome chronic pelvic pain.<br />Your personal treatment plan may include:<br />Pelvic floor physical therapy can help you develop a coping strategy for your pain. This can include stretching, massage and other ways to relax.<br />Medicines, including pain relievers, hormone treatments, antibiotics, anti-depressants and anti-seizure drugs, may be used to help manage your chronic pain.<br />Psychotherapy can help with the depression and anxiety that usually accompany chronic pain.<br />Trigger point injections may be helpful if you have specific spots in your pelvis where you feel pain. Your doctor can inject a medicine right into the painful spots. The medicine is usually a strong anesthetic.<br />Laparoscopic surgery allows your doctor to see the inside of your pelvis. In some cases, your doctor may also remove tissue during your laparoscopic procedure.<br />Surgery may be considered in some cases. Based on your diagnosis, you may be able to have minimally invasive surgery or robotic surgery. These surgeries cause less pain and blood loss and allow you to return to normal activities sooner.<br />Hysterectomy to remove your uterus. This treatment is used in rare, complicated cases of chronic pelvic pain.<br />",

      "bodyAndBreast": "<a></a><br />Body and Breast Procedures<br />Breast Procedures<br />When you want to change how your breasts look, you want a procedure designed with your unique needs and goals in mind. Whether you want a breast augmentation or you’re considering reconstructive surgery after breast cancer treatment, we offer a range of procedures that will help you feel like your very best self.<br /><a href='#collapse1'>Breast Augmentation</a><br />If you’re not satisfied with the size or shape of your breasts, an augmentation procedure may be able to help you reach your aesthetic goals. We use silicone or saline gel implants to help you get the look you’ve always wanted.<br /><a href='#collapse2'>Breast Lift</a><br />Life takes its toll on your body. Over time, you may find that your breasts have become lower or lost shape. Pregnancy, breastfeeding and weight loss can all add to these changes. A breast lift, or mastopexy procedure, can help. During this procedure, we remove the excess skin around the breasts and tighten the tissue that supports the breasts. This helps to support and lift your breasts. Based on your goals, breast lifts may also use implants.<br /><a href='#collapse3'>Breast Reconstruction</a><br />After breast cancer surgery, you have one goal – feeling like yourself again. Our board-certified reconstructive surgeons are here to discuss your goals and give you choices for restoring the size, shape and feel of your breasts.<br />We encourage you to discuss reconstructive surgery with your breast surgeon before you have a mastectomy or lumpectomy. Sometimes, reconstructive surgery can be performed at the same time as your breast cancer surgery. This means you might spend less time in the hospital and more time healing at home.<br /><a href='#collapse4'>Breast Reduction</a><br />Some women feel their breasts don’t fit their body size. Not only that, large breasts may cause back, neck and shoulder pain. A breast reduction can help ease discomfort while still shaping your breasts to fit your body. Our highly experienced surgeons will remove excess breast tissue before remodeling the breast and nipple.<br />Breast reduction surgery isn’t just for women. Men also have breast tissue that may not be in proportion to their bodies. Male breast reduction surgery, or gynecomastia, can remove excess tissue. We perform this procedure using liposuction or surgery.<br />Breast Reduction Surgery<br /><a> <img src='http://i3.ytimg.com/vi/00eQ4YpFl8U/maxresdefault.jpg' alt='Promedica' /></a><br />Dr. Thomas Flanigan explains how breast reduction surgery is performed and how it can help both men and women.<br />Body Contouring<br /><a href='#collapse5'>Tummy Tuck</a><br />A tummy tuck, also called abdominoplasty, removes excess fat and skin from the abdomen. This procedure can also help renew weakened or separated muscles in the abdomen, which is a common issue after pregnancy. A tummy tuck creates a smoother and firmer abdominal profile.<br />",
      "facialProcedures": "<a></a><br />Facial Procedures<br />Your face expresses who you are. If you feel wrinkles or sagging skin keep you from showing yourself to the world, we can help. The board-certified plastic surgeons at ProMedica offer a range of surgical and nonsurgical facial procedures to help you achieve the look you feel is truly you.<br /><a href='#collapse11'>Dermal Fillers and Volumizing Injections </a><br />Both dermal fillers and volumizing injections can add fullness to the skin of the face. These nonsurgical treatments lessen the appearance of wrinkles around the nose and corners of the mouth. Although they have similar effects, the two treatments are slightly different. Fillers address wrinkles and depressions in the face. Volumizers actually stimulate collagen production for a more filled-out look.<br />Our surgeons and medical aestheticians have broad experience with dermal fillers and volumizing injections. They can guide you to the best approach to give you a natural, youthful appearance.<br />We offer the following dermal fillers and volumizing injections:<br />Belotero Balance®<br />Juvederm® and Juvederm Voluma.<br />Perlane.<br />Restylane.<br />Sculptra Aesthetic.<br /><a href='#collapse12'>Endoscopic Lift</a><br />An endoscopic lift is an innovative, minimally invasive approach to brow and forehead lifts. An endoscopic lift tightens loosened skin and removes wrinkles that are simply part of the aging process. This approach can offer a variety of benefits, including:<br /><a href='#collapse13'>Regenexx AD™ (Adipose Derived)</a><br />Regenexx AD™ (Adipose Derived) treatment combines our traditional Regenexx SD™ procedure with stem cells taken from fatty tissue (adipose stem cells).<br />This can be used to solve structural problems within the joint.<br />Faster recovery.<br />Less pain.<br />Lower risk of complications.<br /><a href='#collapse14'>Eyelid Rejuvenation</a><br />As we age, the skin around our eyes loses its elasticity. The result? A tired appearance that can make us look older than we feel. Eyelid rejuvenation, or blepharoplasty, helps you appear more alert and refreshed.<br /><a href='#collapse15'>Facial Rejuvenation</a><br />Facial rejuvenation, or facelift, can help you appear younger and more refreshed. Facial rejuvenation can be achieved surgically or nonsurgically with laser resurfacing treatments.<br /><a href='#collapse16'>Fat Grafting</a><br />Fat grafting, or fat injection, transfers fat from one area of your body to another area where you want more volume. This procedure is considered a permanent filler, especially when used for face and lip injections.<br /><a href='#collapse17'>Neck Lift</a><br />A neck lift, or rhytidectomy, can help you achieve a smoother neckline and improve visible signs of aging. During the procedure, your surgeon will remove excess skin and fat from around the neck and sculpt a natural silhouette.<br /><a href='#collapse18'>Rhinoplasty</a><br />Rhinoplasty, or cosmetic nose surgery, can enhance the way the nose looks in proportion to the rest of the facial features. It can also help improve a range of noncosmetic issues such as breathing problems caused by a deviated septum or a birth defect.<br /><a href='#collapse19'>Wrinkle-Relaxing Injections</a><br />Wrinkle-relaxing injections, also called neuromodulators, are a temporary way to improve the look of moderate to severe frown lines between the brows and around the eyes. We use Botox® Cosmetic and Xeomin to help men and women achieve a smoother, more youthful appearance.<br />",

      "conditions": "<a></a><br />Foot and Ankle Conditions<br />ProMedica's podiatry team can handle everything from routine checkups and conservative treatments to reconstructive surgery for a variety of conditions, including those listed below.<br /><a href='#collapse1'>Achilles Tendon</a><br />The Achilles is the longest and largest tendon in the body. The tendon runs from the back of the calf muscle to the heel. One of the common conditions that affect the Achilles tendon is Achilles tendonitis, which is inflammation and swelling of the tendon. Another problem is Achilles tendonosis, which is degeneration or weakening of the tendon. Both conditions raise the risk of a ruptured tendon.<br /><a href='#collapse2'>Ankle Instability</a><br />Ankle instability means there’s weakness or a recurring 'giving way' of the outside of the ankle. The condition can be inherited but is usually because of an earlier ankle injury that hasn’t been properly treated or hasn’t been completely rehabilitated. Repeated sprains can cause more ligament and joint damage and lead to arthritis.<br /><a href='#collapse3'>Ankle Sprain</a><br />Sprains involve injury to one or more ankle ligaments, usually on the outside of the ankle. Ligaments are bands of tissue, like thick rubber bands, that connect one bone to another at the joints. The ligaments control and limit the joint’s motion. The sprain’s severity depends on whether the ligament(s) are stretched, partially torn or completely torn. At a minimum, a complete exam and X-rays are needed to accurately diagnose and treat the injury.<br /><a href='#collapse4'>Athlete’s Foot</a><br />This skin disease is caused by a fungal infection that often occurs between the toes. The infection can spread across the entire bottom of the foot and cause dryness, cracking, itching and blisters. Feet are prone to fungal infections because shoes create a warm, dark and humid environment. This encourages fungus growth. Other conditions that can mimic athlete's foot infections are eczema, psoriasis and allergic reactions to shoe dye or glue.<br /><a href='#collapse5'>Bunions</a><br />A bunion is a visible bump of bone that reflects changes to the bony framework at the ball of the foot. Bunions tend to get worse over time. Bunions are usually caused by wearing high-heeled or pointed shoes that crowd the toes.<br /><a href='#collapse6'>Charcot Foot</a><br />Charcot foot occurs when the bones and joints in the foot break down because of nerve damage (neuropathy). Charcot foot is a very serious condition that can lead to severe deformity, infection, disability and even amputation.<br /><a href='#collapse7'>Diabetic Foot </a><br />The most common complications of diabetes that affect the foot are nerve damage (neuropathy), decreased or blocked blood circulation <a href='/services-and-conditions/peripheral-artery-disease-pad'>(PAD)</a> and decreased response to infection (immune compromise). These problems put people with diabetes at a higher risk for serious infections or foot wounds.<br />People with diabetes should check their feet closely. It’s also very important to have regular foot exams with a podiatrist. Any sudden swelling or redness in the feet could mean there’s a serious problem.<br /><a href='#collapse8'>Fractures</a><br />Bone fractures can be divided into two categories: traumatic fractures and stress fractures. Traumatic fractures are caused by an incident, a direct blow or an injury that results in bruising, swelling and pain. Stress fractures are caused by repeated stress over time that leads to more pain and swelling. Stress fractures can cause pain during activity that may go away after rest. They can be caused by more intense exercise or new activity.<br /><a href='#collapse9'>Fungal Nails</a><br />Fungal nails are caused by fungus or yeast infections of the nail or nail bed. Often associated with athlete's foot, this condition can become chronic and may resist treatment. Toenail fungus can usually be treated with conservative treatments.<br /><a href='#collapse10'>Ganglion Cyst</a><br />A ganglion cyst is a benign growth under the skin that contains a jelly-like fluid. They can vary in size, and get smaller or larger over time. They’re common on the foot and the wrist and are often located near a tendon or joint. Early treatment can help avoid surgery for larger lesions.<br /><a href='#collapse11'>Gout </a><br />Gout is a painful disorder usually associated with the big toe. It happens when uric acid collects in a joint or in the tissues. Symptoms of gout include sudden intense pain, redness, swelling and extreme skin sensitivity in the affected area. Blood tests and joint fluid analysis are used to diagnose gout.<br /><a href='#collapse12'>Hallux Rigidus</a><br />This is an arthritic condition of the joint that’s located at the base of the big toe. Hallux rigidus is a form of degenerative arthritis, which means the joint cartilage has worn away. It can cause bone spurs to form and joints to enlarge. It’s a progressive condition that causes pain, stiffness, swelling and inflammation of the big toe joint.<br /><a href='#collapse13'>Hammertoe</a><br />A hammertoe is a bend in one or both joints of a toe. Hammertoes usually get worse over time. Left untreated, the toe can become permanently contracted. People may develop corns or ulcers on the toes because of the toe deformities. Surgery may be needed to straighten the hammertoe.<br /><a href='#collapse14'>Heel Pain</a><br />Heel pain is most often caused by plantar fasciitis, an inflammation of the tendon-like band of tissue that runs from the heel to the ball of the foot. Heel pain may also be caused by a stress fracture, bone spur, tendonitis, arthritis or nerve irritation. Because there are many causes, it’s important to have heel pain properly diagnosed by a podiatrist.<br /><a href='#collapse15'>Ingrown Toenail</a><br />An ingrown toenail happens when the nail curves down or inward and grows into the skin at the nail border. Symptoms include skin irritation, pain, redness and swelling in the toe. The affected toe is often irritated by shoe or sock pressure. If an ingrown nail causes a break in the skin, bacteria may enter and cause an infection.<br /><a href='#collapse16'>Metatarsalgia</a><br />Metatarsalgia is a generalized term used to describe pain in the ball of the foot. There is often swelling in this area.<br /><a href='#collapse17'>Morton’s Neuroma</a><br />Morton's neuroma is the most common neuroma in the foot. A neuroma is when nerve tissue between the base of the third and fourth toes in the foot becomes enlarged and scarred. It’s caused by compression, trauma or irritation of the nerve. Patients describe a sharp pain or numbness in the associated toes, cramping in the foot or the sense that their sock is curled up under the ball of the foot. If a neuroma isn’t treated, it could lead to permanent nerve damage.<br /><a href='#collapse18'>Osteoarthritis</a><br />Osteoarthritis is a condition characterized by the breakdown and eventual loss of cartilage from the surface of the joint. When 'wear and tear' causes the cartilage to become weak, painful symptoms develop that can keep someone from easily doing daily activities. In the foot, the disease often occurs in the big toe joint, but it’s also found in the midfoot and ankle joints.<br /><a href='#collapse19'>Plantar Fasciitis</a><br />Plantar fasciitis is an inflammation, weakness or tearing of the tissue called the plantar fascia, anywhere along the bottom of the foot. Symptoms are usually worse when first standing in the morning or after sitting for periods of time. Wearing poorly constructed shoes or shoes without support, going barefoot or even wearing flip-flops can cause this problem.<br /><a href='#collapse20'>Posterior Tibial Tendon Dysfunction (PTTD)</a><br />PTTD is an inflammation, weakness, overstretching or tearing of the posterior tibial tendon inside the foot and ankle. In PTTD, the tendon's ability to help support the arch is impaired and results in the food becoming flat. PTTD is often called 'adult acquired flat foot.' Orthotics or braces may help keep the foot from collapsing. Surgical repair may be needed.<br /><a href='#collapse21'>Tailor’s Bunion</a><br />A tailor's bunion is when the bone at the base of the little toe becomes enlarged. It’s also called a bunionette. Bunionettes are aggravated by shoe pressure. Wearing shoes that are too tight can make the deformity worse over time.<br /><a href='#collapse22'>Tarsal Tunnel Syndrome</a><br />Tarsal tunnel syndrome happens when the post tibial nerve is compressed. The post tibial nerve runs along the inside of the ankle into the foot. Tarsal tunnel syndrome is similar to carpal tunnel syndrome of the wrist. The nerve compression may at first cause numbness or pain at the great toe, pain in the heel or cramping in the arch. As the condition goes on, it can lead to muscle wasting, chronic foot pain and permanent nerve damage.<br /><a href='#collapse23'>Warts</a><br />Warts are caused by a viral infection in the skin. Warts come in different shapes and sizes and include flat warts, mosaic warts and plantar warts. Different types of warts respond best to different treatments. Most can be treated with topical medicine, though some need laser treatment, freezing (cryotherapy) or surgical removal.<br />",

      "treatment": "<a></a><br />Foot and Ankle Treatments<br />Most foot or ankle conditions can be treated by combining conservative treatments. We can perform many treatments, including minor procedures, right in our office. Our treatments include:<br />Custom foot orthotics: Orthotics are special shoe inserts that support your feet and restore normal foot function. They’re custom-made for your foot using a digital image, foam impression or plaster casting.<br />Diagnostic ultrasound: An ultrasound uses sound waves to create an image of the foot or ankle. It helps us diagnose soft tissue issues such as tendonitis, tendon tears, plantar fasciitis and cysts.<br />Minor office surgeries: Our office is equipped to perform many minor surgeries. Under local anesthesia, your foot doctor can safely correct ingrown or fungal nails, remove warts or bone spurs and relax tight tendons and joints.<br />PADnet testing: PADnet testing checks the blood circulation in your legs and feet. It can help detect blockages caused by <a href='/services-and-conditions/peripheral-artery-disease-pad'>peripheral artery disease</a> (PAD). A person with PAD has a higher risk of stroke, heart attack and serious foot problems.<br />Sural nerve conduction study: This study can help us diagnose diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN). Neuropathy, or nerve damage, in the legs and feet can cause numbness, tingling and pain. It’s often one of the first symptoms of diabetes. This test gives results in less than one minute and can find signs of neuropathy even when symptoms are minor.<br />X-rays: Our office uses high-speed, low-dose X-rays to help find and diagnose fractures, bone spurs, arthritis and other bone problems in the feet and ankles. We take and process X-rays during your visit to quickly and efficiently diagnose your condition.<br />",

      "articleContent": "About Positron Emission Tomography (PET Scan)<br />Your doctor has discussed the need for a PET. Understand what it is, what to expect, and how it might benefit your health.<br />What is a PET?<br />Commonly called a PET scan, PET stands for positron emission tomography. It’s commonly requested in order to provide more information about how the following organs and tissues are working:<br />Brain<br />Heart<br />Lung<br />Breast<br />How does a PET scan work?<br />During your PET, you’ll be injected with a small amount of radioactive material, called a tracer. This tracer travels throughout your body and collects in your organs and tissues, giving your radiologist a highlighted view of the area under examination.<br />In order for your radiologist to assess your body’s function, you’ll lie still on a table and pass through a tunnel-like machine. This machine will detect the tracer and transform the signals into the image your radiologist will assess.<br />Why is a PET scan important to your health?<br />Generally, a PET gives your doctor a much more complete picture as to the origin or causes of symptoms you might have. Clear information means concise treatment; and focused treatment gives you the best opportunity to improve your health. Also, a PET can have results that indicate that your body is functioning just as it should, therefore ruling out serious conditions.<br />",

      "articleContent": "Understanding Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder<br />Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a condition that occurs after one experiences an emotionally or physically frightening event. The person is so affected by the ordeal that they develop frequent memories or flashbacks of it. When exposed to situations that resemble the traumatic event, they undergo severe emotional, mental and physical distress.<br />PTSD symptoms can start soon following the event and improve shortly after or they may persist long-term.<br />Common PTSD Symptoms<br />Signs vary, but you may notice any, or all, of the following:<br />Avoiding certain situations or places<br />Depression<br />Difficulty concentrating<br />Experiencing physical discomfort (headaches, stomachaches)<br />Fearing death at an early age<br />Having frequent flashbacks or intrusive memories<br />Irritability<br />Loss of interest in activities you used to enjoy<br />Lost touch with reality<br />Having nightmares<br />Trouble at work or in school<br />Events That Trigger PTSD<br />Specific examples of events which typically cause PTSD:<br />Abuse – physical or emotional<br />Animal bites<br />Automobile accidents<br />Experiencing a natural disaster (such as a flood or hurricane)<br />Invasive medical procedures<br />Man-made tragedies (bombings and shootings)<br />Neglect<br />Sexual assault or molestation<br />Violent attacks (mugging, torture, kidnapping, being held captive)<br />If you believe you may have PTSD, schedule an appointment with a provider who works in behavioral health. Counselors, therapists, psychologists, and psychiatrists are all examples of providers who may be able to help diagnose and treat your PTSD.<br />PTSD in Children and Adolescents<br />Children and adolescents can suffer from PTSD. A child with PTSD will exhibit many of the same symptoms that an adult might. In addition to the standard symptoms, children may also begin acting younger than their age (thumb-sucking, wetting the bed). Many times, PTSD started during childhood develops into a chronic disorder. However, PTSD can be treated with therapy.<br />Can PTSD be prevented? As a parent, you may be able to reduce the risk of traumatic experiences in your child.<br />Preventing PTSD in Children and Adolescents<br />Teach your child to say NO to someone who tries to touch them inappropriately or make them uncomfortable.<br />Offer support and counseling to children who have undergone a traumatic experience.<br />Support prevention programs within your community and at your child’s school.<br />If you suspect your child may have PTSD, contact your pediatrician for a proper evaluation. If further assessment is needed, your pediatrician may recommend a comprehensive evaluation by a licensed behavioral health professional.<br />",

      "aboutProstateCancer": "<a></a><br />Understand Prostate Cancer<br />Understanding prostate cancer and how it affects your body is an important part of fighting cancer. It can help you make more informed decisions about your care.<br />Prostate cancer, second only to skin cancer, is the most common cancer in American men. The American Cancer Society estimates that there will be more than 174,000 new cases of prostate cancer diagnosed yearly.<br />The prostate is a gland located below the bladder and in front of the rectum. It produces a fluid that together with other fluids produces sperm. The prostate is about the size of a walnut, but can be much larger in older men. Almost all prostate cancers are adenocarcinomas, which are cancers that start in gland cells.<br />Prostate cancer grows slowly. If confined to the prostate, it may not cause any serious damage. Prostate is less likely than other cancers to spread (metastasize) to other parts of the body.<br /><a href='#collapse11'>Know Your Risk</a><br />One in nine men will be diagnosed with prostate cancer during his lifetime. But the good news is that, as with most cancers, the earlier you catch it, the easier it is to treat.<br />Since you may not show signs or symptoms, especially if your prostate cancer is in its early stages, knowing you’re at higher risk can help you stay on top of taking preventive measures and having regular screenings.<br />Men may have a higher risk for prostate cancer if they:<br />Are African American.<br />Are over age 65.<br />Have a family history of prostate cancer.<br />Live in North America, northwest Europe, Australia or Caribbean Islands.<br /><a href='#collapse12'>Recognize the Symptoms</a><br />Since symptoms aren’t easy to notice, especially in the early stages, prostate cancer can sneak up on you. But knowing what to look for can help. Talk with your doctor if you have:<br />Blood in your urine or semen.<br />Bone pain.<br />Loss of bladder or bowel control.<br />Problems urinating.<br />Trouble getting an erection.<br />Weakness or numbness in your legs or feet.<br /><a href='#collapse13'>Screening and Diagnosis</a><br />Prostate cancer screenings can usually detect this disease in its early stages. If you’re 50 or older, or you’re at a higher risk for prostate cancer, talk to your doctor to create a screening schedule that’s right for you.<br />Prostate cancer screening will usually begin with yearly or twice-yearly exams that include a:<br />Physical exam.<br />Digital rectal exam (DRE).<br />Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test.<br />Based on the results of your DRE and PSA screenings, your doctor may want you to have more tests.<br />Prostate Ultrasound<br />An ultrasound probe is inserted gently into your rectum. This allows your doctor to scan your entire prostate and check for abnormalities inside and around your prostate. This is often performed along with a prostate biopsy.<br />Prostate Biopsy<br />Tiny pieces of prostate tissue are removed using small needles. They are checked for cancer cells. Biopsies are the only way to know if you have prostate cancer.<br />Call <a href='419-291-3000'>419-291-3000</a> or <a href='1-800-479-8805'>1-800-479-8805</a> to schedule your prostate cancer screening.<br />",

In some cases, one form of treatment could be effective. But in many cases your doctor might suggest combining multiple treatment methods to help you achieve the best possible outcome.<br />Your personal treatment plan may include:<br /><a href='#collapse21'>Chemotherapy</a><br /><a href='/services-and-conditions/chemotherapy'>Chemotherapy</a> is a cancer treatment given intravenously (through a vein) to stop cancer cells from growing. Chemotherapy drugs work by killing the cells or keeping cells from dividing. It may be given before or after surgery.<br /><a href='#collapse22'>Radiation Therapy</a><br /><a href='/services-and-conditions/radiation-therapy'>Radiation therapy</a> uses high-energy X-rays to shrink and kill cancer cells. It’s usually given after surgery or chemotherapy to lower the risk of the cancer returning.<br /><a href='#collapse23'>Immunotherapy</a><br />Immunotherapy, also called biotherapy, uses substances made from living organisms to help the body fight cancer and other diseases. These substances may be synthetic or they may occur naturally.<br /><a href='#collapse24'>Hormone Therapy</a><br />Hormone therapy for prostate cancer reduces the levels of male hormones called androgen. Lowering androgen levels can shrink prostate cancers and make them grow more slowly.<br /><a href='#collapse25'>Cryotherapy</a><br />Cryotherapy uses very cold temperatures to freeze and destroy cancerous cells.<br /><a href='#collapse26'>Surgery</a><br />The most common prostate cancer surgery is a prostatectomy or removing the prostate. ProMedica offers this procedure using innovative robotic technology. This minimally invasive procedure has several potential benefits, including:<br />Effective cancer control.<br />Faster return of urinary continence and sexual function.<br />Less pain.<br />Fewer potential side effects.<br />Quicker recovery.<br /><a href='/services-and-conditions/surgical-services'> Learn more about robotic surgery. </a><br />",

    "content": {
      "articleContent": "<br />Understanding Pelvic Congestion Syndrome<br />Chronic <a href='/services-and-conditions/pelvic-pain'>pelvic pain</a>, defined as pain lasting six months or more, affects 15% of women in America. Many issues can cause this pain. But, did you know that a vascular problem could be one of them?<br />Pelvic congestion syndrome (PCS) is a condition that causes chronic pelvic pain due to problems with your veins in your lower abdomen. Veins carry blood from all areas of your body back to the heart. However, in some women, the veins in the lower abdomen have weakened, making their veins inefficient at moving the blood back up to their heart. This allows blood to build up or pool, causing pressure and bulging veins resulting in varicose veins in the pelvis.<br />Some sub-types of pelvic congestion syndrome include ovarian vein reflux, nutcracker syndrome, and May-Thurner syndrome.<br />New Procedure Offers Speedier Recovery for Patients with Nutcracker Syndrome<br /><iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/DeVyzgrxO7E?enablejsapi=1'></iframe><br />Who is at risk for pelvic congestion syndrome?<br />PCS mostly effects women of childbearing age. It is also common in women who have had two or more pregnancies and those who have a family history of venous disease.<br />What are the symptoms of pelvic congestion syndrome?<br />The main symptom of pelvic congestion syndrome is pelvic pain that lasts at least six months. Often, the pain starts during or after a pregnancy. Many women describe the pain as a severe, dull ache that worsens around the time of their menstrual period. Others describe the pain as heavy or sharp.<br />Other symptoms include:<br />Pain before or during a heavy menstrual flow<br />Frequent urge to urinate<br />Varicose veins on the external genitals, thighs and/or hemorrhoids<br />Activities that can worsen the pain include:<br />Changing your posture<br />Having sexual intercourse (pain can occur both during and after)<br />Standing or sitting for long periods of time<br />Traveling on long automobile trips or flights<br />Walking<br />How is pelvic congestion syndrome diagnosed?<br />Pelvic pain is not easy to diagnose. Your primary care provider (PCP) or gynecologist will need to consider the many possible causes of pelvic pain, including problems with your reproductive, urinary or gastrointestinal systems. To diagnose, your doctor will typically obtain a complete medical history, perform an abdominal and pelvic exam, Pap smear, and order blood work.<br />After ruling out other pelvic problems, a vascular expert like the ones at <a href='/services-and-conditions/vascular-care/vascular-institute'>Jobst Vascular Institute</a> may be consulted. This specialist may recommend additional testing such as:<br /><a href='/services-and-conditions/ultrasound'>Ultrasound </a>– A Doppler ultrasound to check the blood flow in the pelvic blood vessels.<br /><a href='/services-and-conditions/computed-tomography-ct-scan'>Computed tomography (CT)</a> or <a href='/services-and-conditions/magnetic-resonance-imaging-mri'>magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) </a>– Imaging that provides more detailed pictures of your pelvic veins.<br />What are the next steps?<br />Once you have been diagnosed with PCS, know that today more treatments than ever are available. Your gynecologist may prescribe hormone medications to relieve pain. Your gynecologist may also recommend that you talk with a Jobst vascular surgeon for additional treatment options. Most of these treatments are minimally invasive and can be performed in an outpatient setting.<br />To learn more about treatment options, call Jobst Vascular Institute Vein Care at <a href='tel:4192912090'>877-551-VEIN (419-291-2090)</a>.<br />",

      "disorders": "<a></a><br />Understanding Pelvic Floor Disorders<br />Pelvic floor disorders are conditions that affect your pelvic floor, which includes the muscles, ligaments and nerves at the bottom of your pelvis. In men and women, the pelvic floor supports the bladder, rectum and bowel. It also supports a woman’s reproductive organs.<br />It’s common for a woman’s pelvic floor to weaken after pregnancy and childbirth. But men can also have pelvic floor weakness. This can be caused by surgery, constipation, heavy lifting or other bladder and bowel problems.<br /><a href='#collapse1'>Know Your Risk Factors</a><br />When the surrounding muscles are weak, your pelvic organs can’t work correctly. You can protect your pelvic health by understanding the characteristics and activities that put you at risk for a pelvic floor disorder. This will also help you avoid disruptive and painful symptoms.<br />Your pelvic floor muscles can weaken from:<br />Aging.<br />Being overweight.<br />Birth defects.<br />Emotional stress.<br />Enlarged prostate gland or treatment for another prostate problem.<br />Heavy lifting.<br />Menopause.<br />Nerve damage from spinal cord injuries, diabetes, Parkinson’s disease and multiple sclerosis.<br />Overactive bladder.<br />Pregnancy and childbirth.<br />Smoking.<br />Stool build-up in the bowels.<br />Urinary tract infections.<br /><a href='#collapse2'>Recognize the Symptoms</a><br />While most people have the same symptoms, the severity can vary widely. We can help, whether your symptoms are very minor or are so severe they’re affecting your quality of life. Talk with a doctor if you have:<br />Constipation.<br />Trouble urinating.<br />Frequent or urgent urination.<br />Leaking urine or feces.<br />Pain in the lower back.<br />Pain with intercourse.<br />Pelvic pain or discomfort.<br />Pressure or fullness in the pelvis.<br /><a href='#collapse3'>Types of Pelvic Floor Disorders</a><br />Fecal Incontinence<br />When you have fecal incontinence, it means you can’t hold your stool. Although it’s not a normal part of getting older, you are more likely to have fecal incontinence as you age. It can also be caused by:<br />Congenital problems.<br />Diabetes.<br />Diarrhea or constipation.<br />Injuries from having a baby or being pregnant.<br />Injuries or diseases of the spinal cord.<br />Large hemorrhoids.<br />Severe dementia.<br />Severe inflammation.<br />Surgery involving the anal sphincter.<br />Tumors.<br /><a href='#collapse4'>Pelvic Organ Prolapse</a><br />Pelvic organ prolapse happens when your pelvic floor becomes so weak a pelvic organ drops into your pelvis. Sometimes, these organs can even fall into or outside the vagina or anus.<br />There are different types of prolapse, including:<br />Cystocele (bladder).<br />Enterocele (small bowel).<br />Rectocele (rectum).<br />Urethrocele (urethra).<br />Uterine (uterus).<br />Vaginal vault (vagina).<br />Many people with pelvic organ prolapse don’t have any symptoms at all. However, if symptoms are present, they may include:<br />Bulging in the vagina.<br />Feeling of heaviness, fullness, aching or pressure in the pelvis or lower belly.<br />Frequent or urgent need to urinate.<br />Frequent urinary tract infections (UTIs).<br />Inability to completely empty the bladder.<br />Inability to pass stool without laxatives.<br />Lower back pain.<br />Needing to push organs back up into the vagina to urinate or have a bowel movement.<br />Pelvic pressure that gets worse when standing, lifting or coughing, or as the day goes on.<br />Problems putting in tampons or vaginal applicators.<br />Sexual dysfunction or pain during sex.<br />Uncontrolled urine leakage.<br /><a href='#collapse5'>Urinary Incontinence </a><br />Urinary incontinence — the loss of bladder control — is a problem many of us could face as we get older. Cases can range from mild (a bit of leaking when you cough or sneeze) to more severe (a sudden and urgent need to urinate without being able to hold it).<br /><a href='/services-and-conditions/incontinence'>Learn more about urinary incontinence</a>.<br /><iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/4lD_vyuNGRo?enablejsapi=1'></iframe><br />Pelvic Organ Prolapse<br />Hear from ProMedica urogynecologist Dr. Dani Zoorob about the symptoms and treatments for pelvic organ prolapse.<br />",

Not only is this the first step in getting back to your everyday life, this simple visit can help you prevent more serious problems later on.<br />During your consultation, the doctor will likely recommend that you have:<br />A physical exam.<br />A discussion about your personal and family health history.<br />A discussion about your symptoms.<br />Imaging tests to check the muscle and nerves in your pelvis may also be recommended. (These tests will sometimes be scheduled at another time or location.) In some cases, women may be referred to a doctor who specializes in treating pelvic floor disorders in women (urogynecologist).<br />Regardless of your unique situation, your care team will be with you every step of the way to coordinate your examinations and test results. We’ll be sure you understand your condition, so you’re empowered to make the best possible health decisions.<br />Talk to an expert: Call <a href='tel:567-585-0240'>567-585-0240</a> to make an appointment.<br />Access a Full Range of Treatment Options<br />At ProMedica, you’ll have access to a full range of treatment options, from minimally invasive therapies to traditional surgery. Once you have a diagnosis, your care team will help you carefully consider the right treatments for you.<br />Many pelvic floor disorders can be treated without surgery. In fact, it’s likely your doctor will recommend behavioral therapies, nonsurgical treatments or physical therapy before having you consider surgery. In some cases, you may have a combination of all these treatments first.<br /><a href='#collapse11'>Behavioral Therapies</a><br />Behavioral therapy for pelvic floor disorders may include:<br />Bladder training:  You’ll be taught ways to help you increase the amount of time between urinating and resisting the urge to urinate.<br />Lifestyle changes: Many lifestyle changes can help you manage your symptoms. These include things like changing your diet, adjusting how much fluid you drink and limiting your caffeine and alcohol intake.<br />Scheduled toileting: By scheduling your toilet breaks to prevent leaking, you can train your bladder to empty every two to four hours.<br /><a href='#collapse12'>Nonsurgical Treatments</a><br />Nonsurgical treatments for pelvic floor disorders can include:<br />Medicines: Your doctor may prescribe incontinence medicines or estrogen therapy.<br />Pessaries: Made out of plastic or silicone and inserted into your vagina, these small, removable devices can keep your pelvic organs in place. Your doctor may recommend a pessary to help with stress incontinence or pelvic organ prolapse.<br />There are different types of pessaries. If you need one, your device will be fitted to your body to make sure it’s comfortable for you.<br /><a href='#collapse13'>Physical Therapy</a><br />In some cases, physical therapy can help with pelvic floor disorders. This can include pelvic floor exercises such as kegels, and biofeedback.<br />Our pelvic floor physical therapists specialize in treatments that strengthen your pelvic floor. If you think you may benefit from pelvic floor physical therapy, talk to your doctor. You’ll need a referral to begin pelvic floor physical therapy.<br /><a href='/services-and-conditions/pelvic-floor-physical-therapy'>Learn more about pelvic floor physical therapy</a>.<br /><a href='#collapse14'>Surgery</a><br />In some cases, surgery may be the only way to treat your pelvic floor disorder. If that's the case, our fellowship-trained surgeons will work with you to determine the best surgical option for you. to find the right treatments.<br />Many disorders can be treated with minimally invasive surgery, including robot-assisted procedures. The benefits of minimally invasive surgery include:<br />Faster return to normal activities.<br />Less blood loss.<br />Less injury to tissue.<br />Less pain.<br />Shorter hospital stays.<br />",

A doctor who suspects a bone or joint problem may also ask for an imaging test. These tests can include X-rays, ultrasounds, MRIs or CT scans.<br />Many children are diagnosed with a bone or joint problem shortly after they’re born. If there’s a problem after your baby is born, your doctor will ask one of our specialists to visit the nursery.

      "articleContent": "Treating Chronic Pelvic Pain with Physical Therapy<br />Pelvic floor physical therapy is an evidence-based, non-surgical approach to treating <a href='/services-and-conditions/pelvic-pain'>chronic pelvic pain</a> and pelvic floor disorders. <a href='/services-and-conditions/pelvic-floor-disorders'>Treatment starts with an assessment by a specially-trained physical therapist (PT)</a>, who has received specialized training in evaluating and treating pelvic floor disorders. The initial evaluation typically includes:<br />Checking the motor control, strength, and endurance of core support muscles<br />Assessing your pelvic floor muscle coordination for different activities and positions<br />Other testing, as needed.<br />Based on the findings of this exam, the physical therapist creates a unique treatment plan to help you improve your pelvic floor function. The treatment plan may include working with you on behavioral approaches such as bladder re-training techniques. Plus, an individualized physical therapy regimen to help rehab your pelvic floor muscles. The physical therapist may use a variety of techniques. Specific treatments help to improve urinary and/or fecal continence.<br />Pelvic floor physical therapy is NOT…<br />Just for women. Men, women and children suffer from pelvic floor disorders and could benefit from therapy.<br />Just massage and kegels. A variety of techniques are used to treat patients.<br />Evaluation or treatment involving speculums or stirrups—neither is used in pelvic floor physical therapy<br />A “one size fits all” program. Treatment is uniquely designed to your specific needs.<br />How can pelvic floor physical therapy help me?<br />The treatments used by our pelvic floor physical therapists are designed to address issues with the structures of the pelvic floor (i.e. nerves, lymphatics, muscles, connective tissue, skin, and bones). Pelvic floor physical therapy exercises and treatments aim to improve:<br />The leakage of urine or loss of bladder control<br />Painful sex and vaginal pain<br />Sexual dysfunction (male and female)<br />Pelvic pain and discomfort in the vaginal area with or without sexual interactions<br />Pelvic organ prolapse (the dropping of the bladder, rectum or uterus)<br />Constipation or incomplete bowel or bladder emptying<br />Back, hip or sacroiliac joint (SI) pain that has not improved with time or traditional treatment<br />Talk to a specialist; call <a href='tel:1-419-824-1968'>419-824-1968</a> to schedule an appointment today.<br />What should I expect when I visit the pelvic floor physical therapist?<br />Our certified and well-trained therapists welcome you in a comfortable and friendly environment. We also believe in a team approach to care so that you are in control of your treatment.<br />At your first visit, we’ll do an initial evaluation that lasts about 60 minutes. This evaluation typically includes:<br />A detailed discussion including an explanation of your medical history and your condition<br />Checking the motor control, strength, and endurance of core support muscles<br />Assessing your pelvic floor muscle coordination for different activities and positions<br />An external and external and internal assessment of your pelvic floor function including strength, coordination, tone, and sensation<br />Based on the findings of this exam, we’ll create a unique treatment plan to help you improve your pelvic floor function. The treatment plan may include working with you on behavioral approaches such as bladder re-training techniques. Plus, an individualized physical therapy regimen to help rehab your pelvic floor muscles. The physical therapist may use a variety of techniques specific to your needs.<br />Kegels and More for Your Pelvic Health<br />Pelvic floor physical therapist may utilize a number of different therapies to treat chronic pelvic pain and pelvic floor disorders, including:<br />Stretching exercises, massage and other relaxation techniques<br />Kegel exercises: Regular, daily exercise of pelvic muscles can make the pelvic floor muscles stronger and improve, and even prevent, urinary incontinence.<br />Biofeedback: Uses different types of devices to give information on how well pelvic muscles are contracting. The message or “feedback” can help improve awareness and control of pelvic floor muscles. This is often used along with Kegel exercises to help patients gain awareness and control of the pelvic muscles.<br />Vaginal weight training: Small weights are held within the vagina by tightening the vaginal muscles.<br />Pelvic floor electrical stimulation: Mild electrical pulses stimulate muscle contractions. This may be done along with Kegel exercises.<br />",

      "articleContent": "Understanding Peripheral Artery Disease<br />Peripheral artery disease (PAD), also known as peripheral arterial disease, occurs when narrowed arteries reduce the amount of blood flow to your legs, most commonly, but sometimes to your arms. This narrowing is caused by fatty build up, called plaque, that clings to your artery walls. This lack of blood flow causes symptoms, though you may not notice symptoms in the early stages.<br /><iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/JwOxAE0BoAM?&amp;enablejsapi=1&amp;rel=0'><br />        </iframe>  <br /> <br /> <a target='blank' href='/assets/images/vascular-services/peripheral-artery-disease/vascular-peripheral-artery-disease-info.jpg'>Learn more about PAD with our infographic. </a><br />PAD Signs and Symptoms<br /><iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/lCihriDo5KQ?&amp;enablejsapi=1&amp;rel=0'><br />        </iframe>  <br />What are the symptoms of PAD?<br />Painful cramping or aching calf, hip, or thigh muscles when walking.

This is a common condition in children and frequently requires treatment that is dependent on the severity and the child’s age.<br /><a href='#collapse12'>Nightmares and Night Terrors</a><br />These are both very common in children and usually do not require significant treatment. However, it is important to differentiate these from disorders that require treatment.<br /><a href='#collapse13'>Insomnia (difficulty sleeping)</a><br />When a child has trouble falling asleep, staying asleep or both. There are many possible causes for insomnia, such as behavior, delayed sleep phase, medications or an underlying medical diagnosis.<br /><a href='#collapse14'>Hypersomnia (sleepiness)</a><br />Hypersomnia is when a child is sleepy during the day, even after a full night of sleep. A sleep study may be necessary to help determine the quality of your child’s sleep.<br /><a href='#collapse15'>Restless Leg Syndrome (RLS)</a><br />When a child experiences uncomfortable feelings in their legs while they are laying down at night.

      "articleContent": "<br />Using Radiation Therapy to Treat Cancer<br />Radiation therapy is the use of high-energy X-rays to treat cancer. These are therapeutic X-rays, which are different from diagnostic X-rays. Radiation can be an effective cancer treatment and is designed to prevent cancer cells from growing and multiplying. The goal is to slow or stop tumor growth and, in many cases, completely destroy the tumor.<br />Your radiation therapy treatment is administered in stages. You’re supported by experienced professionals and caregivers along the way.<br />What are the steps to radiation therapy treatment?<br />Your first visit. This is a consultation to discuss your cancer and treatment options with your <a href='#providers'>radiation oncologist</a>. This is a time to ask questions. If possible, bring a family member.<br />Simulation. Your radiation oncologist uses X-ray equipment called a “simulator” to aid in your treatment plan. Sometimes, a non-toxic dye is injected in order to outline certain organs. Prior to the simulation, your radiation therapist places you into a special positioning device that will hold your body still during treatment.<br />Planning marks. During your simulation, you’re given either small black permanent marks, about the size of a freckle, or similarly sized semi-permanent marks. These marks create a focal point for the radiation treatment machine so treatment can be given to precisely the same spot each time.<br />Receiving treatments. A machine called a “linear accelerator” provides your therapeutic radiation dosages. You’ll lie on a table, sometimes shielded by protective blocks, and will be raised under the linear accelerator. The treatment machine will move to a predetermined position and apply the radiation treatment. You won’t feel or see the radiation. Expect weekly assessments while you’re given treatment to see how your body responds.<br />Follow-up care. It’s extremely important to schedule regular exams after you’ve finished your radiation treatment. This may include blood work and X-rays. Continue to maintain a healthy lifestyle after your treatment is complete.<br />What are the side effects of radiation therapy? Side effects differ, depending on the treatment area. The most common are fatigue and skin irritation. Your doctor or nurse will discuss ways to prevent or minimize these effects with you, including nutrition for managing fatigue.<br />",

      "faq": "<a></a><br />Frequently Asked Questions<br />At ProMedica, we want you to feel confident in your treatment decisions. Our specialists will take the time to discuss your options for regenerative medicine and answer any questions you may have.<br /><a href='#collapse21'>What is regenerative medicine?</a><br />Regenerative medicine is a same-day, nonsurgical adult regenerative procedure that treats common injuries and degenerative joint conditions. Regenerative cells are growth cells found naturally in the body. They adapt to become almost any type of cell and rejuvenate hard-to-repair tissues like cartilage.<br /><a href='#collapse22'>Am I a candidate for regenerative medicine?</a><br />When you meet with one of our regenerative medicine specialists, we’ll review your test results and medical history to determine your eligibility. We’ll consider a number of factors, including your:<br />Activity level.<br />Age.<br />Body mass index.<br />Condition of the joint.<br />Medicines.<br />Overall health.<br />Past medical and surgical history.<br /><a href='#collapse23'>What can I expect during the procedure?</a><br />During the procedure, we withdraw a small amount of whole marrow from the back of your hip bones. Cells are processed from the bone marrow and injected into the injured part of the body. A procedure typically takes one to three injections.<br />You will go home the same day and be able to resume light activity within a week. You may start to see positive results between 6-8 weeks post procedure, and may continue to see results thoughout the year.<br /><a href='#collapse24'>Can you have more than one treatment at a time?</a><br />It’s possible to treat multiple areas at once, but your doctor will help you decide if this is a good choice for you.<br /><a href='#collapse25'>How much does it cost? </a><br />Blood-derived injections start at $1,200. A bone marrow procedure, which consists of three injections done within a seven to ten day time frame, costs anywhere from $6,000 to $11,000. This is based on which part of the body is being treated, the number of injection sites and any protocol recommended by the doctor. We are not able to offer payment plans for our services.<br /><a href='#collapse26'>Is regenerative medicine covered by insurance? </a><br />Regenexx® procedures aren’t covered by most insurance providers. The procedures are still too new and are considered experimental. But we’re happy to give you a copy of your statement and medical records if you decide to submit on your own behalf after the procedure is completed.<br />",
      "conditions": "<a></a><br />Benefits of Regenerative Medicine<br />Regenerative medicine doesn’t just treat symptoms. It heals your body at the source of the injury by using your own body’s healing growth factors. This may help heal damaged tissues, tendons, ligaments, cartilage, spinal discs and bones.<br />We offer the Regenexx® family of regenerative medicine procedures. Now you can get same-day treatment for many joint conditions to ease your pain, and help you move and heal faster.<br />Conditions We Treat<br />We treat a variety of orthopaedic conditions with regenerative medicine. This includes sports injuries and degenerative conditions, such as arthritis. Our doctors will assess your condition and decide on the best course of treatment for your unique needs. Our goal is to reduce your pain and increase your mobility so you can get back to doing the things you love.<br /><iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/P_u5LpD6ke8?enablejsapi=1'></iframe><br /><a href='#collapse0'>Elbow</a><br />If you have elbow pain, regenerative medicine could be an excellent treatment option. Our outpatient procedures may help restore elbow function and decrease pain without the need for surgery. With image guidance, we inject the right amount of your body's natural healing mechanism into the exact areas of damage. This may tighten and stabilize your elbow joint for better function and mobility.<br />Some elbow conditions we treat include:<br />Tennis and Golf Elbow: People with tennis or golfer’s elbow often struggle to open a door or shake someone's hand. Regenerative medicine may improve function and mobility.<br />Ulnar collateral ligament UCL) injuries: This ligament holds the elbow together. Injuries are especially common among baseball pitchers due to the physical strain to the arm.<br /><a href='#collapse1'>Foot and Ankle</a><br />Common foot and ankle conditions may improve with regenerative medicine. This includes degenerative conditions such as osteoarthritis, as well as tendon and ligament tears.<br />Ankle ligament tears: Ankle sprains often cause stretched or torn ligaments. This can change how you walk and put painful stress on foot joints, increasing your risk for another ankle sprain. This incomplete healing leads to a cycle of chronic pain and instability. Regenerative medicine may promote healing in damaged ligaments and improve function and mobility.<br />Ankle osteoarthritis: Osteoarthritis of the ankle leads to tenderness, pain, swelling, stiffness and even an inability to bear weight. This can change how you walk, increase stress on the foot and may lead to injury. Regenerative medicine may tighten and stabilize your ankle for better function and mobility.<br />Ankle tendon tears: Damage to the Achilles tendon is the most common form of tendon damage. It often results from acute injury or overuse often as a result of athletics. Regenerative medicine may promote repair of strains and tears to the Achilles tendon.<br />Toe osteoarthritis: This condition can cause toes to bend sideways and create painful bone spurs. If left untreated, the big toe in particular can become rigid, putting more stress on the rest of the foot and ankle. Regenerative medicine may promote repair, leading to better function and mobility.<br /><a href='#collapse2'>Hand and Wrist</a><br />Wear and tear on the wrists and hands is common in a world filled with hand-held devices and keyboards. As we place more and more strain on our hands and wrists, they can wear down over time. Regenexx may treat injuries and degenerative problems related to the hand or wrist.<br />TFCC tear: The triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) contributes to use of our opposable thumbs. Wear or injury can lead to wrist pain and swelling. Regenerative medicine may reduce pain and discomfort and help restore function.<br />Carpal tunnel syndrome: Roughly 5% of people in the workplace have carpal tunnel syndrome. This condition causes pain, numbness, or tingling in the thumb, index finger, middle finger, and inside of the ring finger. Regenerative medicine may loosen the pinching and restore function.<br />Thumb Osteoarthritis: Hand and thumb osteoarthritis is the second most common type of arthritis. Movements from writing, using a phone, and other daily activities cause the cartilage to wear down. Regenerative medicine may help stabilize the thumb joint for better function and mobility. Patients in the Regennexx registry reported almost 50% improvement in function and reduction in pain on average.<br /><a href='#collapse3'>Hip</a><br />Hips have many tendons, ligaments and muscles around the joint that can sustain injury. Conditions such as hip labrum tears, hip tendon tears and hip osteoarthritis and degeneration may improve with regenerative medicine.<br />We use image guidance technology to inject your own bone marrow concentrate — which contains stems cells — directly where it’s needed to repair damaged tissue in the hip joint structure. The cells in your bone marrow concentrate work at the site of your injury to promote the growth of new, healthy tissue. This aids in the stabilization of your hip joint for better function and mobility. It may also help reduce pain.<br /><a href='#collapse4'>Knee</a><br />The knee has many parts that keep it protected, stable and mobile. To relieve knee pain, you must first figure out what’s causing the pain. Knee pain can be caused by an acute injury or by chronic wear and tear of the knee, such as osteoarthritis or degenerative joint disease. Common knee conditions include:<br />Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) tears: There are numerous types of ACL tears. Some may require surgical repair, but many may be treated with regenerative medicine.<br />Knee osteoarthritis: Knee osteoarthritis (OA) is one of the most common orthopaedic conditions. If can negatively impact your quality of life and enjoyment of daily activities. Your doctor can help determine if you are a candidate for regenerative medicine.<br />Meniscus tears: The meniscus is a cushion of cartilage between the bony ends of your thigh bone and shin bone. This cartilage acts as a shock absorber during movement. Tears of the meniscus can be the result of wear and tear on the joint or can occur when there’s an injury.<br />Some knee conditions need rest and/or special exercises prescribed by a physical therapist. If pain or function does not improve, it may require advanced medical attention. Our experts are highly trained in diagnosing and treating knee issues. Regenexx procedures may help improve knee function, but in some cases, surgery may be the best solution.<br /><a href='#collapse5'>Shoulder</a><br />The shoulder joint is the most mobile joint in your body. When there's an injury or degenerative disease, your body struggles to keep the joint stable. Tendons and ligaments may stretch or tear due to trauma, or simply wear out due to age. This allows too much motion in the joint. The added motion may lead to bone spurs or arthritis.<br />Common conditions affecting the shoulder include:<br />Rotator cuff tears: The rotator cuff is a series of muscles and their tendons that surround the shoulder. It helps move the shoulder while supporting this ball in the socket joint. The tendons can become torn with trauma or wear and tear. This can cause pain and weakness in the shoulder. An MRI or ultrasound image is used to make the diagnosis.<br />Labrum tears / SLAP tears: The labrum is a cup-shape rim of cartilage that lines and reinforces the ball-and-socket joint of the shoulder. A direct injury to the shoulder or prolonged wear and tear may lead to a shoulder labrum tear. Regenerative medicine procedures may help treat these tears.<br />Shoulder osteoarthritis and degeneration: The cartilage in your shoulder cushions the bone and reduces friction. Arthritis occurs when this cartilage starts to wear down or is injured. This leads to chronic shoulder pain, stiffness, limited shoulder function, and decreased mobility. Shoulder arthritis impacts nearly 25% of adults. Regenerative medicine procedures may be an alternative for people looking to avoid surgery.<br /><a href='#collapse6'>Spine</a><br />If you’re living with back pain, regenerative medicine may help restore spinal function and decrease pain without surgery. During this outpatient procedure, our expert physicians use image guidance to inject custom concentrations of your body’s natural healing tools into and around the areas of damage. This may help stabilize your spine and improve overall function and mobility.<br />Regenerative medicine may be an effective treatment for the following spine conditions:<br />Bulging disc.<br />Continued pain after lower back surgery.<br />Herniated discs.<br />Torn disc.<br />Neck pain.<br />Sacroiliac joint pain.<br />Spondylolysis.<br />Spinal stenosis.<br /><a href='/services-and-conditions/lp/regenerative-medicine'>Request a consultation with one of our regenerative medicine specialists </a><br />",

Regenexx® procedures offer viable options for people with chronic pain who may be thinking of having surgery.<br /><a href='#collapse11'>Regenexx SD™ (Same Day)</a><br />Regenexx SD™ (Same Day) is a Regenerative Medicine procedure that uses bone marrow from your hip. The regenerative cells are concentrated in a bedside machine, then enriched and injected into the damaged joint.<br /><a href='#collapse12'>Regenexx PL-Disc™</a><br />Regenexx PL-Disc™ helps you avoid back surgery for herniated discs and the side effects of steroid treatments commonly used for spinal issues. The goal of the procedure is to use your own healing growth factors to reduce inflammation and heal or manage disc-related injuries. The outpatient procedure allows you to return to normal activity (as tolerated) right away, does not damage vital back muscles, and has few complications.<br /><a href='#collapse13'>Regenexx AD™ (Adipose Derived)</a><br />Regenexx AD™ (Adipose Derived) treatment combines our traditional Regenexx SD™ procedure with regenerative cells taken from fatty tissue (adipose). This can be used to solve structural problems within the joint.<br /><a href='#collapse14'>Regenexx SCP™ (Super Concentrated Plasma)</a><br />Regenexx SCP™ (Super Concentrated Plasma) treatment gathers cells from your blood and uses them to repair damaged tissues<br /><a href='#collapse15'>Regenexx PL (Platelet Lysate)</a><br />Regenexx PL (Platelet Lysate) treatment allows your doctor to concentrate all of the growth benefits to one area of your body. Our doctors create Regenexx PL by cracking open the platelets to allow all of the growth factors to be available in a specific area of your body right away. This is especially useful for areas of the body where using Platelet Rich Plasma (PRP) may cause too much inflammation.<br /><a href='#collapse16'>Platelet Rich Plasma (PRP) Therapy</a><br />Platelet rich plasma (PRP) therapy combines platelets that are separated from your blood. These materials are then injected into the injury site to stimulate repair without causing blood clots.<br />Call <a href='tel: +14195787515'>419-578-7515</a> to schedule a consultation.<br />Are Regenerative Medicine Treatments Right for You?<br /><a>  <img src='http://i3.ytimg.com/vi/Qyzj_CPZHrQ/maxresdefault.jpg' alt='Is stem cell therapy right for you' /></a><br />Roger Kruse, MD, ProMedica Regenerative Medicine, talks to Chrys Peterson, ProMedica Health Correspondent, about what Regenerative Medicine treatments do, and who's a good candidate.<br />",

The rehabilitation and therapy professionals at ProMedica Total Rehab understand. That’s why we provide complete physical, occupational, speech and aquatic therapy services for a wide range of health conditions.<br /><a href='#collapse1'>Balance Disorders</a><br />A balance disorder is a condition that makes you feel unsteady or dizzy. If you’re lying down, sitting or being still, it may feel as though you or the area around you is moving. If you’re walking, you may feel as though you’ll tip over.<br />A licensed physical therapist at ProMedica can perform a thorough evaluation of your balance disorder by observing your posture and how you move. Your therapist will then determine the strengths and weaknesses of your balance system and work with you to form a treatment plan and exercises for you to do at home.<br />In some cases, a balance disorder is because of an underlying condition such as a brain injury or infection. Your therapist will always work closely with your doctor to make sure you’re getting complete care.<br /><a href='#collapse2'>Cancer</a><br />After going through cancer treatment, you want to feel like yourself again. Our cancer rehab program helps survivors minimize treatment-related side effects and work toward the best possible quality of life. Some of the issues we help treat include fatigue, weakness, insomnia and memory loss.<br /><a href='/services-and-conditions/cancer-survivorship'>Learn more about services for cancer survivors.</a><br /><a href='#collapse3'>Orthopaedic Conditions </a><br />Whether you’re dealing with a degenerative (weakened) condition like osteoarthritis, you’re recovering from surgery, or you have a sports injury, we can create a custom treatment plan to help make the most of your mobility.<br />Orthopaedic conditions we treat include:<br />Ankle sprains.<br />Back or neck pain.<br />Carpal Tunnel Syndrome.<br />Fractures.<br />Knee injuries.<br />Osteoarthritis.<br />Rotator cuff tears.<br />Sprains and strains.<br />Tendonitis.<br /><a href='#collapse4'>Pediatric Conditions </a><br />Your child has unique needs and, no matter what, comfort and gentle care are key to healing.

A plan of care will be designed to help you or a loved one achieve the best possible outcome in recovery.<br />For patients with a stroke and spinal cord injury, our wearable robotic exoskeleton, called EksoNR™, allows them to begin to take steps sooner and initiate gait faster. ProMedica is the first in northern Ohio to add this advanced technology to its comprehensive rehabilitation program.<br /><a href='/services-and-conditions/robotic-exoskeleton-therapy-and-rehab'>Learn more about the robotic exoskeleton.</a><br /><a href='#collapse6'>Women’s Health and Incontinence</a><br />Have you had minor or occasional leaks of urine? <a href='/services-and-conditions/urinary-incontinence'>Urinary incontinence</a> affects about 25 million Americans.

This condition, caused by a damaged lymphatic system, is called lymphedema. <a href='/services-and-conditions/lymphedema-therapy'>Lymphedema therapy</a> can help reduce swelling, pain and the risk of infection.

That’s why we’re here to answer all your questions about rehabilitation and therapy. For more information, please call <a href='tel:+1-877-425-5734'>1-877-425-5734</a>.<br /><a href='#collapse11'>Do I need a doctor’s prescription for therapy?</a><br />Yes. You should always discuss the option of rehabilitation with your doctor. They can decide if it’s safe for you to have therapy for your health condition<br /><a href='#collapse13'>Do I need a referral for therapy?</a><br />Some insurance providers require a referral form (this is separate from a physician prescription). Please contact your insurance company for more details.<br /><a href='#collapse14'>Will my insurance pay for therapy?</a><br />The best way to understand your insurance coverage is to contact your insurance company. There are many different health plans that provide various kinds of coverage.<br /><a href='#collapse15'>What do I need to bring with me?</a><br />Please bring your insurance card and photo ID, along with paperwork from your doctor or forms that you may have filled out ahead of time. Be sure to wear or bring clothes that are comfortable enough for exercise and allow for access to the area of your body that’s being treated.<br /><a href='#collapse16'>What can I expect from my therapy session?</a><br />You can expect:<br />A treatment plan that you and your therapist discuss during the first evaluation.<br />Follow-up sessions if needed, that are scheduled to meet your financial and lifestyle requirements.<br />A written plan of care and progress reports that are shared with the referring provider.<br />A home program designed to meet your specific needs.<br /><a href='#collapse17'>How long will my appointment take?</a><br />Your first appointment will take about an hour.

Follow-up appointments will take from 30 to 60 minutes.<br /><a href='#collapse18'>How many visits will I need?</a><br />The number of visits each patient needs varies and is based on many different reasons. Your therapist will be able to give you an estimate after reviewing your physician’s orders, completing your initial assessment and talking with you about your treatment plan.<br /><a href='#collapse19'>Will therapy hurt?</a><br />You may have discomfort because you’ll be exercising areas that are recovering from an injury or procedure.

Therapies such as manual therapy, massage, ice and heat are often used for pain control.<br /><a href='#collapse20'>Will I receive exercises to do at home?</a><br />Yes. One of the most important aspects of your recovery will be doing the at-home exercises your therapist recommends. Your therapist will write down instructions, tell you what to do, give you pictures or provide all three.<br /><a href='#collapse21'>Will the therapist talk to my doctor?</a><br />Your therapist will send your plan of care and progress notes to your referring physician to explain your therapy treatments. Your therapist and doctor may also speak directly with each other during your care if there are any questions or concerns.<br /><a href='#collapse22'>Are ProMedica therapists licensed?</a><br />All of our physical, occupational and speech therapists are licensed.

A new, advanced robotic technology is now available to help get patients up and walking again.<br />The EksoNR™ is the first ever FDA approved, wearable robotic exoskeleton for stroke and spinal cord rehabilitation. With early and repetitive use, patients are getting up sooner after their injury, beginning to take steps sooner, and initiating gate faster.<br />ProMedica is the first in Northern Ohio to add this advanced technology to its comprehensive rehabilitation program. It adds another tool to what therapists can use to get their patient mobilized early.<br />How It Works<br />The EksoNR™ is designed with custom software that allows clinicians to amplify a patients’ natural ability to activate muscles and produce movement. Real-time software adjustments can be made for customized patient rehabilitation sessions. Torso support with the EksoNR™ helps to correct posture and hip width can be adjusted during sessions. Ankles are supported and kept stable. Patients report feeling secure as they re-learn correct step patterns, weight shifting and work on their posture.<br />Learn more through our outpatient services at <a href='tel:+8774255734'>877-425-5734</a>.<br />What It Means to Patients<br />With use of the EksoNR™, patients gain not only mobility quicker, but confidence and independence as well. The device improves:  <br />Functional Balance<br />Walking Distance<br />Gait Speed<br />How a Patient Gets Referred<br />Patients referred to therapy receive a comprehensive assessment during their evaluation.

The surgeons at ProMedica use the da Vinci® Surgical System, a revolutionary tool that helps our surgeons perform several common surgeries through an incision that’s less than an inch long.<br /><a href='#faq1'>Benefits of Robotic Surgery</a><br />Because of the small incision and greater accuracy, the benefits of robotic surgery include:<br />Faster recovery.<br />Fewer complications after your surgery.<br />Less blood loss.<br />Less pain.<br />Minimal scarring.<br />Quick and safe return to your daily activities.<br /><a href='#faq2'>Robotically Assisted Procedures</a><br />Our surgeons use the da Vinci® Surgical System for a wide range of surgeries, including:<br />General robotic surgery.<br />Gynecologic robotic surgery.<br />Thoracic (lung) robotic surgery.<br />Urologic robotic surgery.<br /><a href='#faq3'>How It Works</a><br />Even though it’s called a robot, the da Vinci® Surgical System can’t perform surgery or make decisions. Your surgeon controls the robotic arms with joystick-like controls from a console a few feet from the operating table.<br />During surgery, a powerful scope is inserted through an incision just one or two centimeters (about .5 – .75 inches) long. A camera is attached to the outside of the scope. This gives your surgeon a highly detailed view of the surgical site. Through three-dimensional, binocular-like lenses that magnify up to ten times, your surgeon is able to see details within hundredths of an inch.<br /><a href='#faq4'>Our Robotic Surgery Team</a><br />Our robotic surgery team offer compassionate care using the da Vinci® Surgical System with a human touch. They’re all backed by well-trained robotic surgical support teams of nurses and technicians who work together to make sure you have minimal scarring, a faster recovery and less pain after your surgery.<br />",

Some people may have minor hand shaking while remaining conscious, while others may lose consciousness as their entire bodies convulse.<br />Signs of a seizure may include:<br />A blackout, followed by confusion.<br />Uncontrollable muscle spasms.<br />Drooling or frothing at the mouth.<br />Falling.<br />Experiencing a strange taste in your mouth.<br />Clenching teeth.<br />Sudden, rapid eye movements.<br />Making unusual noises, such as grunting.<br />Losing bladder or bowel control.<br />Sudden mood changes.<br /><a href='#collapse2'>Types of Seizures</a><br />Epileptic Seizures<br />Epilepsy is a nervous system disorder that can cause seizures. However, just because you have one seizure does not mean you have epilepsy. A minimum of two unprovoked seizures are usually the conditions for an epilepsy diagnosis.<br />Non-Epileptic Seizures<br />Non-epileptic seizures may be caused by psychological issues or stress and are not accompanied by abnormal electrical activity in the brain.<br />Provoked Seizures<br />Provoked seizures are single seizures that may occur as the result of trauma, low blood pressure, low blood sodium, high fever, or alcohol or drug abuse. Unlike provoked seizures, unprovoked seizures do not have an obvious physical cause. Unprovoked seizures are the main symptom of epilepsy.<br />",

Your neurologist may order additional testing, such as:<br /><a href='#collapse6'>Treating Epilepsy and Seizures</a><br />While there is no cure for epilepsy, ProMedica provides effective treatment options for controlling and eliminating seizures. Epilepsy is typically a long-term condition. But when it is managed properly, its impact on your daily life can be minimized.<br />Medications<br />After evaluating your condition, your provider may prescribe an individualized medical management regimen. Medication options for epilepsy include anticonvulsants, nerve pain medications, or sedatives.<br />Seizure Prevention<br />Even after you start your medication regimen, you may still experience seizures. You can prevent or reduce your seizure risk by avoiding common triggers, such as:<br />Lack of sleep.<br />Flashing lights.<br />Video games.<br />Use of heroin or cocaine.<br />Abrupt withdrawal from medications or alcohol.<br />Surgery<br />In certain cases, your physician may evaluate the benefits to surgery. Surgery for epilepsy is sometimes recommended for patients who have severe and frequent seizures which cannot be treated by medication.<br /><a href='/services-and-conditions/neurosurgery'> Learn more about neurosurgery at ProMedica.</a><br />",

The disease affects people of all races, but most commonly people who are Black, Hispanic, or of Middle Eastern, Mediterranean and Indian backgrounds.<br />Sickle cell disease causes red blood cells to change from being round and flexible to stiff, sticky and sickle-shaped. These cells can’t travel through blood vessels well and break down quickly.<br />The most common problems associated with sickle cell disease include anemia and blockage of the flow of blood in the tissues. It can cause swelling, pain and other complications. Over time, because of sickling of the red blood cells, patients can also develop chronic organ damage to almost any organ. Bone, kidney, lung and spleen are the most common sites of chronic damage.<br /><img src='/assets/images/medical-services/sickle_cell_illustration.jpg' alt='An illustration of how normal blood cells versus sickle-shaped blood cells flow through blood vessels.

      "articleContent": "<br />About Skin Cancer<br />You want to reduce your risk for skin cancer, or maybe you need to know what to look for. Be informed. Know the signs. Understand how to prevent this disease.<br />What is skin cancer?<br />Skin cancer is a specific form of cancer that develops most often on skin exposed to the sun. The three main skin cancer types are:<br />Basal cell carcinoma. The most common cancer form. Found in the deepest part of your skin’s outermost layer.<br />Squamous cell carcinoma. Develops in the flat, outer skin cells.<br />Melanoma. A malignant tumor that forms in the melanin-forming cells. Often appears as dark brown or black “moles” on your skin.<br />What skin cancer signs should you look for?<br />It’s important to check yourself and have a dermatologist check your skin regularly. Examine not only skin that’s regularly exposed to the sun on your face, arms, lips, and scalp, but also places rarely exposed like the bottoms of your feet, stomach, and palms of your hands. Common signs for each skin cancer type vary.<br />Basal cell carcinoma often appears as:<br />A fleshy colored, flat lesion.<br />A small, white, shiny bump.<br />Squamous cell carcinoma often appears as:<br />A flat, crusty lesion.<br />A raised, hard, red bump.<br />Melanoma often appears as:<br />A mole that changes shape, color, texture, or starts to bleed.<br />A large, brownish, speckled spot.<br />A small irregular spot that appears blue, black, red, or white around the edges.<br />Dark lesions in your mouth, lining of your vagina or anus, or on the palms of your hands, bottoms of your feet, fingertips, or toes.<br />What can you do to prevent it?<br />Skin cancer prevention is within your control. Follow these simple steps to reduce your risk:<br />Wear sunscreen all year long.<br />Avoid the sun at high points of the day.<br />Don’t use tanning beds.<br />Wear protective clothing.<br />Men and women, especially over age 18, should always request a skin exam during regular health check-ups.<br />See your dermatologist regularly for thorough skins checks, early detection, and treatment.<br />What type of doctor treats skin cancer?<br />Most skin cancers can be removed in-office by your dermatologist. However, if your skin cancer is more advanced, you may require a cancer treatment team that could include surgical oncologists, medical oncologists, or radiation oncologists.<br />",

This includes bones, called vertebrae, which protect your spinal cord. And between those bones are discs which help absorb shock and make your spine flexible.<br />Your spinal cord sends information to your brain and your body. So when something happens to your spine, the pain is sharp and more severe because of all the nerves and impulses in that part of your body.<br />Conditions that may cause pain in your spine can include:<br />Arthritis.<br />Bulging, herniated or ruptured disks.<br />Curvature of the spine, including scoliosis.<br />Overuse injuries.<br />Sciatica.<br />Spinal stenosis (narrowing).<br />Sprains, strains or fractures.<br />Trauma.<br />",

It happens when blood can no longer reach the brain, which can cause brain cells to die.<br />When it comes to stroke care, every second counts. The faster you can get medical attention, the better your chances of lowering the long-term effects or preventing death. That’s why it’s important to understand the signs of a stroke. The easiest way to remember is watch for the signs to BE FAST:<br />B – Balance trouble and dizziness.<br />E – Eyes (blurry or double vision).<br />F – Face drooping or numbing (a person’s smile may look uneven).<br />A – Arm weakness (a person can’t hold their arms up).<br />S – Speech difficulty or trouble repeating a simple sentence.<br />T – Time to call 911.<br />Call 911 right away if you spot any of the BE FAST symptoms.

      "types": "<a></a><br />Types of Stroke<br />Strokes can have many different effects on the brain. They can also have many different causes. There are three types of strokes.<br /><a href='#collapse1'>Hemorrhagic stroke (bleeding)</a><br />If you have a hemorrhagic stroke, it means a vessel supplying blood to your brain ruptures and causes bleeding. When an artery bleeds into your brain, oxygen and necessary nutrients can’t reach your brain cells. Brain damage can happen because of the pressure in tissues that surround the brain. About 13% of all strokes are hemorrhagic strokes.<br />There are two types of hemorrhagic strokes:<br />Intracerebral hemorrhages<br />This type of hemorrhagic stroke happens when there is bleeding from the blood vessels within your brain. Besides the common risk factors for a stroke, unique risk factors for an intracerebral hemorrhage include:<br /> Arteriovenous malformations (AVMs):  Groups of blood vessels in your body that form in the wrong way. This causes arteries and veins to get tangled.<br /> Cerebral cavernous malformations (CCM):  Blood vessels that do not form correctly in the brain. For instance, capillaries are tiny blood vessels that group together to form a lesion. A lesion bleeds more easily, and if it bursts and bleeds into the brain, it can cause a stroke.<br /> Dural arteriovenous fistulas (DAVF):  Abnormal connections that take place between arteries and veins in the outer membrane of the brain and cause clots. These most often form during a surgery or injury.<br /> Hypertension:  Also known as high blood pressure, this is the most common cause of stroke.<br />Subarachnoid hemorrhages (SAH)<br />This type of hemorrhagic stroke happens when there is bleeding in-between the brain and the membranes that cover the brain. Besides the common risk factors for a stroke, unique risk factors for a subarachnoid hemorrhage include:<br /> Cerebral aneurysm:  Also known as a brain aneurysm, this is a bulging weakened area in the wall of the blood vessels of the brain. Aneurysms can keep growing in size and weaken the artery wall. If it bursts, uncontrolled bleeding may happen.<br />Warning signs of hemorrhagic stroke include a sudden, severe headache (often described as the worst headache of your life), confusion and being unresponsive.<br /><a href='#collapse2'>Ischemic stroke (clots)</a><br />An ischemic stroke happens when a blood vessel that supplies blood to your brain becomes blocked or clogged. When blood flow is lowered, oxygen and needed nutrients can’t get to your brain. Brain cells and tissues begin to die within minutes. About 87% of all strokes are hemorrhagic ischemic strokes.<br />There are two main types of ischemic strokes.<br />Thrombotic strokes<br />Thrombotic strokes are caused by a blood clot (thrombus) formed in the arteries that supply blood to your brain. When a thrombotic stroke occurs in the tiny, deep blood vessels in the brain, it’s called a lacunar stroke. These are most common in people who have diabetes or hypertension.<br />Besides the common risk factors for a stroke, unique risk factors for a thrombotic stroke include:<br /> Age:  Typically in older adults.<br /> Atherosclerosis:  A buildup of fat and lipids inside blood vessel walls.<br /> Family history and stroke. <br /> High cholesterol. <br />Warning signs of a thrombotic stroke are unique. They can happen while you’re sleeping or slowly over several hours or days. You could also have one or more mini strokes.<br />Embolic Strokes<br />Embolic strokes start when plaque builds up or a blood clot forms in a vessel outside of your head. An embolic stroke happens when this clot travels through your bloodstream and reaches the blood vessels in your brain.<br />Besides the common risk factors for a stroke, unique risk factors for an embolic stroke include:<br />Having AFib.<br />Having heart disease.<br />Undergoing heart surgery.<br />Having carotid stenosis.<br />Having heart failure.<br />Having cardiomyopathy.<br />Signs of an embolic stroke can happen fast or without any warning signs at all.<br /><a href='#collapse3'>Transient ischemic attack (TIA)</a><br />Transient ischemic attacks (TIAs) are sometimes referred to as warning strokes or mini strokes. Unlike a stroke, TIAs don’t cause permanent brain damage. TIA symptoms last less than 24 hours, and often less than one hour. About a third of people who have a TIA will likely suffer a stroke in the next 12 months.<br />With a TIA, an artery is briefly blocked and blood can’t reach a part of your brain. TIA symptoms vary based on the part of the brain that’s affected.<br />Besides the common risk factors for a stroke, unique risk factors for an embolic stroke include carotid artery stenosis. The carotid arteries are the main blood vessels that carry blood and oxygen to your brain. These arteries can become narrowed by fat and lipid buildup, which lowers the oxygen flow to your brain. Blood can’t reach your brain if your carotid arteries are too narrow.<br />TIA symptoms appear to be the same as a stroke, so it’s often hard to tell which type of attack you’re having.<br />",

      "overview": "<a></a><br />Understanding Structural Heart Disease<br />Structural heart disease is a general term used to describe conditions that involve damage to, or flaws in, the anatomy of the heart. It’s different from coronary heart disease, which is caused by plaque in the arteries. Common structural heart disease conditions include, but aren’t limited to:<br />Aortic coarctation.<br />Aortic dilatation or aneurysm.<br />Aortic valve stenosis.<br />Atrial septal defect (ASD).<br />Hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy.<br />Left atrial occlusion.<br />Mitral regurgitation (both degenerative and functional mitral regurgitation).<br />Mitral stenosis.<br />Paravalvular leaks.<br />Patent foramen ovale (PFO).<br /><a href='#collapse1'>Know the Risk Factors</a><br />Most types of structural heart disease can’t be prevented since it’s something you’re likely born with. However, you could be at increased risk for developing structural heart disease due to:<br />Age: As you get older, you become more prone to heart conditions.<br />Family history: Structural heart disease can run in families, and genetic factors can raise your risk.<br />Previous heart issues: High blood pressure, rheumatic fever, atherosclerosis, ischemic heart disease, an earlier heart attack or congestive heart failure can damage the heart.<br />If your structural heart disease is the result of other cardiac problems, managing your existing health conditions can help prevent more damage to your heart.<br /><a href='#collapse2'>Find Fast, Accurate Diagnosis</a><br />Structural heart disease can be difficult to detect in adults, especially since most adult patients don’t seem to experience symptoms. If you do have symptoms, they would likely feel like:<br />Chest tightness.<br />Dizziness.<br />Fatigue.<br />Heart palpitations or flutters, skipping beats or racing heart beats.<br />Trouble with exercise or day-to-day activities.<br />Diagnostic Tests<br />If you’re experiencing any of the symptoms of structural heart disease, your doctor may recommend a series of tests, including:<br />A physical exam.<br />An echocardiogram or ultrasound.<br />A cardiac catheter of the heart.<br />CT scan.<br />MRI.<br /><a href='#collapse3'>Get Effective Treatment</a><br />At ProMedica, we offer a full range of minimally invasive techniques to treat your structural heart condition. These procedures include:<br />Mitral Valve Clip<br />A minimally invasive procedure in which a clip is placed on your heart’s mitral valve to treat mitral regurgitation (a backflow of blood caused when the mitral valve doesn’t close tightly). For patients who aren’t able to have open-heart surgery, this treatment can be performed instead.<br />Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement (TAVR)<br />A minimally invasive procedure that uses a catheter to replace a diseased aortic valve.<br />WATCHMAN™<br />A device implanted into the heart to lower the risk of stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation (AFib). The procedure is minimally invasive and performed with a catheter, so it doesn’t involve open-heart surgery. The WATCHMANTM can be used instead of taking blood thinners. It permanently blocks off the specific area of the heart where AFib causes most blood clots to form.<br />",

The surgeons at ProMedica use the da Vinci® Surgical System, a revolutionary tool that helps our surgeons perform several common surgeries through an incision that’s less than an inch long.<br /><a href='#faq1'>Benefits of Robotic Surgery</a><br />Because of the small incision and greater accuracy, the benefits of robotic surgery include:<br />Faster recovery.<br />Fewer complications after your surgery.<br />Less blood loss.<br />Less pain.<br />Minimal scarring.<br />Quick and safe return to your daily activities.<br /><a href='#faq2'>Robotically Assisted Procedures</a><br />Our surgeons use the da Vinci® Surgical System for a wide range of surgeries, including:<br />General robotic surgery.<br />Gynecologic robotic surgery.<br />Thoracic (lung) robotic surgery.<br />Urologic robotic surgery.<br /><a href='#faq3'>How It Works</a><br />Even though it’s called a robot, the da Vinci® Surgical System can’t perform surgery or make decisions. Your surgeon controls the robotic arms with joystick-like controls from a console a few feet from the operating table.<br />During surgery, a powerful scope is inserted through an incision just one or two centimeters (about .5 – .75 inches) long. A camera is attached to the outside of the scope. This gives your surgeon a highly detailed view of the surgical site. Through three-dimensional, binocular-like lenses that magnify up to ten times, your surgeon is able to see details within hundredths of an inch.<br /><a href='#faq4'>Our Robotic Surgery Team</a><br />Our robotic surgery team offer compassionate care using the da Vinci® Surgical System with a human touch. They’re all backed by well-trained robotic surgical support teams of nurses and technicians who work together to make sure you have minimal scarring, a faster recovery and less pain after your surgery.<br />",

Our surgery options include:<br />Bilobectomy: Removes two of the lobes in the right lung.<br />Decortication: Removes the outer surface (or membrane) of the lung. This allows the lung to expand completely.<br />Empyema: Treats an infection in the lung.<br />Lobectomy: Removes one of the lobes of the lungs.<br />Lung biopsy: Removes a tissue sample from the lungs to be tested for lung disease, cancer or another condition.<br />Pericardial window: Drains fluid from the pericardial sac that surrounds the heart.<br />Pneumonectomy: Surgery to remove the lung.<br />Pneumothorax: Treats a collapsed lung.<br />Robotic thoracic surgery: Offers all the benefits of robot-assisted surgery. Because it makes tiny incisions (cuts) in your chest, most robotic lung-surgery patients experience better outcomes, shorter hospital stays and quicker recoveries.<br />Thoracotomy: Reaches the lungs through an incision in the side of the chest, usually between the ribs.<br />Tracheostomy: Creates a hole in the front of your neck to insert a breathing tube.<br />Video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS) : Removes all or part of a lung using a type of minimally invasive surgery. The surge on uses a special camera called a thoracoscope for a detailed view of the lung. Learn more.<br />Wedge resection (segmental resection): Removes part of the lung.<br />Thoracic Robotic Surgery<br />Until recently, if your doctor suggested lung surgery to remove part your lung, you needed to have a thoracotomy, which means the surgeon made an incision in your chest and seperated your rib cage to expose your lungs.<br />Today, if you have been diagnosed with non-small cell lung cancer or other lung disease and need surgery, our highly trained ProMedica cardiothoracic surgeons offer you the alternative of robot-assisted lung surgery.<br />Thoracic robotic surgery is performed through several tiny incisions in your chest and offers all of the benefits of robot-assisted surgery. Most robotic lung-surgery patients experience:<br />Better outcomes<br />Shorter hospital stays<br />Quicker recoveries<br />If your physician recommends lung surgery, ask if robotic surgery is right for you.<br />",

      "prepareToQuit": "<a></a><br />Prepare to Quit<br />You probably have a few reasons of your own, but there may be reasons to quit smoking that you aren’t aware of. Here are some important ones:<br />You’ll feel better: Tobacco use delays healing. By quitting tobacco, you’ll recover more quickly from cuts, incisions, wounds and broken bones. You’ll soon find you have more energy and are able to breathe easier, too. The time will come when you’ll no longer have urges to smoke, which leaves you free to focus on what’s important in your life.<br />You’ll protect yourself from disease: The health risks of tobacco use include various cancers, asthma, emphysema, heart disease, stroke and diabetes. Pregnant women who smoke have a higher risk of premature delivery, low birth-weight babies, stillbirth and sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS).<br /><a href='#collapse1'>Steps to Becoming Tobacco Free</a><br />Quitting smoking is a big undertaking. That’s why we advise taking it step-by-step.<br />Your personal smoking cessation plan will help you cope with the physical and emotional issues that may come with your decision to stop smoking. These issues include nicotine withdrawal and strong urges to smoke. We’re here to help you prepare for those challenges and stay the course on your journey to becoming tobacco free.<br />The first step is to think through what that journey will look like for you.<br />Mentally prepare to quit: Think about your past attempts to quit. Consider what worked and what didn’t, and open your mind to new ideas.<br />Form healthier habits: Go for a brisk walk or join a gym.<br />Reward yourself: You’ll save money if you stop smoking. As you’re on your way to becoming tobacco free, reward yourself with small things or experiences that reinforce your progress.<br />Create a support system: Get help from family and friends; get group, individual or telephone counseling; or join a support group.<br />Stay away from temptation: Set a no-smoking policy in your home and car, be careful around other tobacco users and avoid alcohol until you’re more comfortable with not smoking.<br />Do your homework and get help from experts: Ask your doctor about medicines to help you quit. Also consider counseling, which doubles your chances of quitting for good.<br />Set a quit date: Remember that your plan and medicines take time to work. Set a date two to four weeks in the future to help you plan and prepare.<br />Make a plan, work your plan: Decide what kind of counseling you want. Talk to your doctor about medicines that can help you quit. Create an emergency plan to help keep you on track. Tweak and adjust your plan as needed.<br />Don’t give up: Remember that every attempt to quit brings you closer to quitting for good. Never quit trying to quit.<br /><a href='#collapse2'>Find Community Support for Quitting Smoking</a><br />You can get more information and resources for quitting tobacco from the following community and public organizations:<br /><a href='https://ohio.quitlogix.org/en-US/'>Ohio Quit Line</a> (call <a href='tel:1-800-784-8669'>1-800-QUIT-NOW</a>)<br />American Cancer Society<br /><a href='https://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/quit_smoking/index.htm'>Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)</a><br /><a href='https://www.heart.org/en/healthy-living/healthy-lifestyle/quit-smoking-tobacco'>American Heart Association</a><br /><a href='#collapse3'>Staying Tobacco and Nicotine Free for Life</a><br />How to Stay Tobacco and Nicotine Free for Life<br /><a>  <img src='http://i3.ytimg.com/vi/WvpNcE7DQMM/maxresdefault.jpg' alt='How to Stay Tobacco and Nicotine Free' /></a><br />A slip is a normal part of learning how to remain nicotine free for life.

Though you won’t hear them, sound waves are sent through your body where they’ll bounce off your body’s tissues. The instrument also receives the sound waves that bounce back. The ultrasound machine will interpret these into a picture that your doctor can review and then make an assessment.<br />",

That means reducing unnecessary antibiotic prescriptions. It also means educating patients on how to use them. We’re committed to developing organization and collaborative solutions, which include:<br />Supporting the tracking and reporting of antibiotic use.<br />Providing ongoing education for urgent care providers and patients about antibiotic stewardship.<br />Implementing procedures that support providers in practicing evidence-based antibiotic prescribing.<br />Supporting scientific evidence that enhances our knowledge, leads to stewardship interventions and builds effective resources for providers and patients.<br />We understand the pressing need for action to preserve the use of these life-saving drugs. We're working to immediately reduce unnecessary antibiotic use while ensuring patients receive the best care and treatment possible. Many challenges lie ahead in the fight against antibiotic resistance. Together we will maximize our chance for success.<br />",

      "conditions": "<a></a><br />Understanding Your Condition<br />Urinary incontinence, or the loss of bladder control, is a common problem. Sometimes it starts with leaking urine when you cough or sneeze. Then it may progress to sudden, sharp urges to urinate that are so strong you can’t get to the bathroom in time.<br />There are several different types of incontinence, including:<br /> Functional incontinence: You have urine control but can’t get to a restroom in time, usually due to a mental or physical condition. For example, if you have arthritis, it’s hard to unbutton your pants quickly.<br /> Mixed incontinence: You experience more than one type of incontinence.<br /> Overflow incontinence: You leak small amounts of urine when your bladder is overfilled and you feel like you can’t empty your bladder.<br /> Stress incontinence: You lose urine while coughing, sneezing, laughing, walking, running or lifting heavy objects. You may also be moving in other ways that put pressure on your bladder.<br /> Urge incontinence: You have frequent, uncontrollable urges to urinate and often can’t get to a restroom in time. Also known as overactive bladder, urge incontinence is common in people who have conditions such as diabetes, stroke, dementia, Parkinson’s disease and multiple sclerosis.<br />Most people assume bladder control issues come with aging. But bladders don’t shrink over time, and problems can happen at any age. Some common causes of urinary incontinence are:<br />Childbirth.<br />Enlarged prostate. In men, stress incontinence or urge incontinence can be associated with untreated prostate cancer. But more often, incontinence is a side effect of prostate cancer treatments.<br />Menopause.<br />Obesity.<br />Poor nutrition.<br />Pregnancies.<br />Weakening muscles that control the bladder valve.<br />",

We can help you understand the cause of your condition, so you can find effective treatment.<br /><a href='#collapse3'>Incontinence </a><br />Incontinence can be troubling. It can also be a side effect of prostate cancer treatment. You’ll find a variety of treatments ranging from noninvasive to surgical that we can offer. We can help you improve your condition and stop worrying.<br /><a href='#collapse4'>Infertility</a><br />About 15% of couples can’t get pregnant during their first year of trying. In about half of those cases, the reason is male infertility. Nearly 2 million men are diagnosed with infertility every year in the U.S. That’s one in 136 men. Our Male Infertility Clinic is led by experts in male infertility who can help you find a solution.<br /><a href='#collapse5'>Prostate Health</a><br />Most prostate diseases aren’t cancerous or life threatening. Still, they’re uncomfortable and inconvenient. The two main benign prostate diseases are prostatitis and benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), or an enlarged prostate. Both can be treated to improve your quality of life. Treatment options include oral medicines, minimally invasive procedures and new surgical methods.<br /><a href='#collapse6'>Sexual and Erectile Dysfunction</a><br />You may feel embarrassed to talk about erectile dysfunction or urinary problems.

You can have an in-office diagnosis along with the added convenience of onsite prostate screening and biopsy. We have our own board-certified urologic pathologist to evaluate biopsy specimens.<br /><a href='#collapseOne'>Bladder Cancer</a><br />Treatment for bladder cancer varies by how far along it has advanced in the bladder, and also depends on your age and overall health. Treatment can include surgery, chemotherapy, radiation and immunotherapy. And, in some cases, we’ll combine treatments for the best results.<br /><a href='#collapseTwo'>Kidney Cancer</a><br />Kidney or upper tract cancer can develop into other types of cancer. Surgery is usually needed to treat kidney cancer. We offer a wide range of methods to successfully remove the cancerous areas.<br /><a href='#collapseThree'>Prostate Cancer</a><br />Prostate cancer is among the most common cancers in men, but it can be treated effectively if it’s caught early. That’s why regular screening for men over 50 is so important. While diagnosed cases have risen rapidly, mortality rates are dropping, in part because more men are aware of their need for screening.<br />We can treat prostate cancer with brachytherapy (radiation), cryotherapy (extreme cold) or robotic surgery.<br /><a href='#collapseFour'>Testicular Cancer</a><br />Testicular cancer is treated successfully in more than 95% of all cases. Treatment depends on the stage and tumor type and may need radiation, chemotherapy or surgical lymph node removal. Onsite imaging with ultrasound and CT scanning can help us find the right treatment for you. Surgery can be performed quickly (if needed) at our ambulatory surgery center.<br />",

During this appointment, you’ll meet with your surgeon to learn what pre-admission testing you need to have. This could include blood work, a chest X-ray, an EKG, dental work and an exam of the arteries in your neck.<br />If you need surgery, you’ll receive detailed instructions that could include starting a new medicine or stopping current ones.<br />During this conversation, you’ll also have a chance to ask questions. It’s important to learn about the procedure and how you’ll manage your health when it’s over. If you have questions, ask them — doing so will help you take better care of yourself.<br />You can start by asking your doctor:<br />How quickly will I recover?<br />What are the pros and cons of each type of valve surgery?<br />What kind of lifestyle changes will I have to make after surgery?<br />Will I need care or rehab after my surgery?<br /><a href='#collapse2'>Post-Surgical Care That Puts You on the Path to Recovery</a><br />Heart valve surgery is an in-depth procedure and requires several days of recovery at the hospital. Most patients are able to go home on the third or fourth day after surgery. Here’s what to expect:<br />You’ll have several tubes inserted and will be connected to monitoring equipment during and after surgery.<br />Your care team will provide updates to your family during your surgery and as you move into recovery.<br />After surgery, you’ll be taken to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) to recover.<br />You’ll consume meals while sitting up in a chair (starting with a clear liquid diet and slowly adding solid food as tolerated).<br />You may be moved to the step-down floor on the first postoperative day.<br />You’ll begin taking short walks in the hallway and start some cardiac rehab therapy exercises.<br />",

      "articleContent": "<br />About the Vascular Lab<br />After a provider takes a detailed medical history and completes a physical exam, testing in a vascular laboratory is often the next step in diagnosing your vascular disease. <a href='/services-and-conditions/vascular-care/vascular-institute'>Jobst Vascular Institute</a>’s accredited vascular laboratory performs more than 30,000 studies each year, including many vascular ultrasounds.<br />These studies help your doctor understand what’s going on with your circulatory system. That body system includes the blood vessels outside of your heart, which carry blood to parts of your body like your brain, abdomen and extremities.<br />Who performs vascular lab tests?<br />Our highly dedicated, well-trained and credentialed vascular technologists will do all that they can to make you feel comfortable during your visit to our vascular lab. We are very proud of our vascular testing accreditation through the Intersocietal Accreditation Commission. It’s one more way to show you how we ensure excellent, quality testing for you.<br />Also good to know: The tests, including vascular ultrasounds, in our labs are non-invasive. That means there’s no need to insert an instrument or device through your skin or into your body. There is also no exposure to radiation because we use sound waves. <br />Once completed, all of our studies are reviewed by one of our board-certified vascular physicians.<br />Jobst Vascular Laboratory is also an education site for local vascular ultrasound training programs including: Owens Community College and Jackson College.<br />Call us today at <a href='tel:+18003956278'>1-800-39-JOBST (56278)</a> to schedule an appointment.<br />What kinds of vascular studies are offered?<br />Jobst Vascular Laboratory is a full-service laboratory that provides many different types of state-of-the-art diagnostic tests. But vascular ultrasound is the most important tool in our lab and the one we use the most.<br />A duplex vascular ultrasound uses sound waves to take pictures of your vessels and a Doppler to listen to blood flow through your arteries and veins. The exam is painless and easy for you. But it provides invaluable information for your physician.<br />Studies performed in our vascular lab include:<br />Cerebrovascular studies of the blood flow to the brain: Carotid artery duplex, transcranial artery Doppler (TCD)<br />Venous: <a href='/services-and-conditions/deep-vein-thrombosis'>DVT (deep venous thrombosis)</a>, CVI (chronic venous insufficiency)<br />Arterial studies to determine the amount of blood flow in your arms and legs: ankle-brachial Index (ABI), pulse volume recording (PVR), segmental pressures, duplex scan graft surveillance<br />Abdominal studies to check the blood flow in the arteries and veins in the abdominal cavity: <a href='/services-and-conditions/ultrasound'>ultrasound </a>of the inferior vena cava, aorta, kidney and visceral arteries<br />Where are your labs located?<br />We have several vascular labs in convenient ProMedica locations across northwest Ohio and southeast Michigan.Each of these locations provides vascular ultraound services.<br />",

      "conditions": "<a></a><br />Understanding Your Veins<br /><a href='#collapse1'>Varicose Veins</a><br />Varicose veins are enlarged, twisted and weakened blood veins. They can happen anywhere on the body but are most common in the legs. Although they're deeper under the skin than spider veins, they appear as bulging veins raised above the skin.<br />While not life threatening, varicose veins can make you feel self-conscious. They can also lead to more serious vein diseases and cause vein pain, such as:<br />A venous stasis ulcer, which forms when there isn’t proper drainage in the enlarged vein.<br />Phlebitis, an inflammation of the vein.<br />Thrombosis, a blood clot that forms in an enlarged vein.<br />Knowing Your Risk Factors<br />While some risk factors are out of your control, there are some steps you can take to prevent the development of varicose veins. Knowing which risk factors apply to you can go a long way in helping you prevent or manage the condition. Risk factors for varicose veins include:<br />Age.<br />Being overweight.<br />Being a woman.<br />Not being physically active.<br />Genes.<br />Pregnancy.<br />Smoking.<br />Taking oral contraceptives or hormone replacement.<br /><a href='#collapse2'>How to Prevent Varicose Veins</a><br />Maintaining a healthy weight and exercising regularly can help stop varicose veins from forming. Other ways to prevent them include:<br />Putting up your feet while sitting.<br />Uncrossing your legs while sitting.<br />Wearing compression stockings.<br /><a href='#collapse3'>Spider Veins</a><br />Spider veins are a milder condition caused by the dilation (expansion) of a small group of blood vessels near the surface of your skin. They often look like a sunburst or “spider web,” are red or blue in color and are often found on the face and legs.<br />At this time, no one knows what causes spider veins. However, contributing factors include age, heredity, hormonal changes and pregnancy.<br />",

Also, you may have one of the following diagnostic tests:<br />Duplex Ultrasound<br />An ultrasound that checks the blood flow and structure of your veins.<br />Color-flow Imaging<br />Also called a triplex ultrasound, this procedure is similar to a duplex ultrasound in that is uses color to show the direction of blood flow.<br />Magnetic Resonance Venography (MRV)<br />MRV uses a combination of large magnets and a computer to view your veins. During this test, a dye is injected into your veins for a better view.<br /><a href='#collapse12'>Find Vein Treatment That's Right for You</a><br />We offer both cosmetic and therapeutic treatments for varicose veins, spider veins and other venous-related conditions. Your vascular specialist will work with you to decide which treatments best fit your condition and your lifestyle.<br />Non-Surgical Treatments<br />Compression stockings: elastic stockings that squeeze your veins and prevent blood from pooling. They’re proven to work when worn daily.<br />Minimally Invasive Options<br />Sclerotherapy: the most common treatment for spider and varicose veins. A concentrated saline solution is injected into the veins and then hardens. This causes the veins to close and collapse. Over time, healthy blood vessels will absorb the blood flow.<br />Endovenous laser ablation: removes veins using high-intensity laser beams or intense pulsating light that’s guided by an ultrasound.<br />Phlebectomy: removes your veins using tiny punctures or incisions (cuts) along the path of the vein. Your surgeon then uses a phlebectomy hook (similar to a tiny crochet hook) to remove your veins through these small incisions.<br />Radiofrequency closure ablations: a treatment that can be used instead of vein stripping. A thin catheter is inserted into the vein through a small opening using a single needle stick. The catheter delivers radio frequency energy to the vein, which causes it to heat, collapse and seal shut. Over time, other healthy veins will take over.<br />VenaSeal™ closure system: a new, minimally invasive procedure that uses an advanced medical adhesive to close the diseased vein. VenaSeal™ is designed to minimize patient discomfort and recovery time. It offers many benefits to the patient including no need for anesthesia or compression stockings after the procedure.<br />Clarivein®: a cathether based treatment that uses a rotating tip to disperse medicine and close damaged veins.<br />Varithena®: a cathether based treatment that injects foam into the diseased vein causing it to close or collapse.<br />Surgical Options<br />Vein stripping: an incision is made in your skin to remove or tie off the blood vessel.<br />",

It includes veins and arteries that carry blood and other fluid all through the body.<br /><a href='/services-and-conditions/vascular-disease'>Vascular disease</a> is a condition that blocks or weakens blood vessels. When blood vessels are narrow or blocked, blood can’t flow easily through the body. This can damage organs or other parts of the body.<br /><a href='#collapse11'>Vascular Conditions</a><br />At Jobst Vascular Institute, you’ll find experts who can help diagnose and treat many vascular diseases, including:<br /><a href='/services-and-conditions/abdominal-aortic-aneurysm'>Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA)</a>. An abdominal aortic aneurysm happens when a part of the aorta weakens and then expands. The aorta is the main artery in the body that carries blood away from your heart to the rest of your body.<br /><a href='/services-and-conditions/carotid-artery-disease'>Carotid artery disease</a>. This is a condition where blood vessels in the neck narrow. The narrowing is usually caused by a buildup of cholesterol in the blood vessels.<br /><a href='/services-and-conditions/deep-vein-thrombosis'>Deep vein thrombosis (DVT)</a>. Deep vein thrombosis happens when a blood clot forms in a vein deep inside your body. The clot usually forms in the leg.<br /><a href='/services-and-conditions/peripheral-artery-disease-pad'>Peripheral artery disease (PAD)</a>. This condition happens when your arteries narrow and reduce blood flow to your arms and legs.<br /><a href='/services-and-conditions/varicose-veins-and-spider-veins'>Varicose and spider veins</a>. Varicose veins are large, swollen veins that you can see through the skin. They usually form in the legs. Spider veins are small red, purple or blue veins that you can also see through the skin.<br /><a href='#collapse12'>Diagnostic Services</a><br />If your doctor thinks you may have a vascular problem, you’ll need vascular testing. At Jobst Vascular Labs, our specialists use advanced testing. This provides accurate results, so your care team can design the best treatment plan for you.<br />Vascular testing usually includes a vascular ultrasound. This painless test uses high-frequency sound waves to create pictures of arteries and veins. A vascular ultrasound may be done on the neck, abdomen, legs, arms, feet or hands.<br /><a href='/find-locations/location-results?LocationText=vascular%20lab'>Find a vascular lab near you.</a><br /><a href='#collapse13'>Treatment Services</a><br />ProMedica vascular experts are building a healthier tomorrow for you and your family.

    "url": "https://www.promedica.org/services-and-conditions/vasectomy",
    "content": {
      "articleContent": "<br />What Is a Vasectomy?<br />A vasectomy is a permanent and effective form of birth control for men. During the procedure, your vas deferens, the tube that carries sperm from your testes, is cut and sealed. This blocks sperm from reaching semen so that, when ejaculated, it cannot get a woman pregnant.<br />The procedure typically takes 20-30 minutes and is safe with few side effects. Usually within a couple of days, you’re feeling better and back to your normal routine.<br />Call <a href='tel:+18448558326'>1-844-855-TEAM</a> for a consultation.<br />Types of Vasectomies<br />Two most common types include:<br />Conventional vasectomy. During this more traditional method, small cuts are made on each side of the scrotum to reach the vas deferens, which are cut, tied or fastened with a metal clip.<br />No scalpel vasectomy. This newer, more modern method is done through one tiny hole in the skin. A tool is used to gently stretch the skin opening so that the vas deferens can be reached. Because no cuts are made, there is little bleeding. It heals quickly with little or no scarring.<br />Debunking the Myths about Vasectomy<br />It’s normal to have questions and concerns about a vasectomy, but sometimes myths about the procedure can lead to unfounded concerns. Here’s the truth about vasectomies. A vasectomy:<br />Won’t affect your sexual performance. A vasectomy won’t affect your sex drive or your masculinity in any way other than preventing you from fathering a child. Men have even reported higher sexual satisfaction after a vasectomy.<br />Is safe for your sexual organs.  There's very little risk that your testicles, penis or other parts of your reproductive system will be injured during surgery.<br />Doesn't increase your risk of certain cancersAlthough there have been some concerns about a possible link between having a vasectomy and getting testicular or prostate cancer in the past, there's no proven link.<br />Doesn’t increase your risk of heart disease.  As with cancer fears, there doesn't appear to be any link between vasectomy and heart problems.<br />Causes minor, not severe, pain. You might feel minor pain and pulling or tugging during surgery, but severe pain is rare. Likewise, after surgery you might have some pain, but for most men the pain is minor and goes away after a few days.<br />ProMedica Vasectomy FAQs<br /><a href='#faq1'>Is a vasectomy right for me?</a><br />Choosing a vasectomy as a form of birth control is a major decision. You should be 100% sure that it is the right decision for you before undergoing this procedure. You and your partner should talk about the decision to not have any more children. Having a vasectomy may be a good choice if:<br />You are an adult male and you are either done having children or don’t want to have children.<br />You are in a stable relationship and both partners agree to permanent birth control.<br />Pregnancy would be a health risk for your partner.<br />You or your partner has a genetic disorder that you don’t want to pass on to a child.<br />To learn more about a vasectomy and ask questions to determine if it is right for you, schedule a consultation with one of our board-certified urologists.<br /><a href='#faq6'>How do I prepare for a vasectomy?</a><br />It is important that you share your medical history with the doctor; include information about drugs (both prescription and over-the-counter), as well as supplements, you are taking. Be sure to tell your doctor about any drug allergies or bleeding conditions you have.<br />Your physician will tell you about any specific things you need to do (and know) to get ready for your procedure. Follow directions and recommendations as explained during the consultation. Wear comfortable, close-fitting underwear. It is recommended that you bring someone to drive you home after the procedure.<br /><a href='#faq7'>What happens during a vasectomy?</a><br />This procedure is most often done in our outpatient surgery center. Your vasectomy will most often be done under local anesthesia, but sedation is available for those who need it. The area will be numbed, but typically you will be awake. It takes about 20 - 30 minutes to complete the procedure.<br />Generally, here’s what happens during a vasectomy:<br />You will be asked to remove any jewelry or other objects that might get in the way during the procedure.<br />You will remove your clothing and put on a hospital gown.<br />You will be asked to empty your bladder.<br />You will lie on your back on an exam table.<br />Your scrotum may be shaved and cleaned with an antiseptic solution or special soap.<br />The surgeon will inject a numbing medicine into your scrotum.<br />The doctor will make either a small cut or opening on one side of your scrotum to find the vas deferens, which will be cut, tied or fastened with a metal clip. The site is closed and a bandage applied. The procedure is repeated on the other side of the scrotum to block the second vas deferens.<br />In many cases, both vas deferens can be reached through the same hole.<br />In some cases, small stitches or skin glue may be used to close the cuts.<br /><a href='#faq8'>What happens after a vasectomy?</a><br />You will likely be able to go home soon after surgery. The staff will watch you closely and the doctor may give you pain medication. You may be told to use an ice pack for the first day to reduce pain and swelling. Here is what you may expect during recovery:<br />Rest at home the day after surgery. Don't do any strenuous activity. Avoid standing or walking too long.<br />Depending on the type of work you do, you may be able to go back in 1 to 3 days.<br />You should be able to return to most activities in a week, but avoid heavy lifting and hard exercise for up to 1 to 3 weeks.<br />You may need to wear a jock strap for a few days.<br />You should not bathe or swim until 1 to 2 days after your vasectomy.<br />You may be able to return to sexual activity in about a week, but you should continue to use another form of birth control until the doctor tests the semen to be sure there are no sperm left. This test is often performed about two months after surgery. It is important to know that vasectomies will occasionally fail and checking semen samples afterwards to confirm sterility is strongly recommended.<br />Vasectomy is very safe, but all surgeries carry some risks. Tell your doctor if you have any of the following:<br />A lump in your scrotum<br />Any drainage, bleeding, redness, or swelling<br />Fever<br />Chills<br />Increasing pain or pain that is not eased by medicine<br />Trouble passing urine<br />Bleeding disorders<br /><a href='#faq9'>Can I have my vasectomy reversed?</a><br />Possibly. Some vasectomies may be reversed, but the process can be more difficult than the actual vasectomy, isn’t always successful and can be expensive. Many insurance providers do not cover reversals.<br />",

They can also lead to more serious vein diseases and cause vein pain, such as:<br />A venous stasis ulcer, which forms when there isn’t proper drainage in the enlarged vein.<br />Phlebitis, an inflammation of the vein.<br />Thrombosis, a blood clot that forms in an enlarged vein.<br />Knowing Your Risk Factors<br />While some risk factors are out of your control, there are some steps you can take to prevent the development of varicose veins. Knowing which risk factors apply to you can go a long way in helping you prevent or manage the condition. Risk factors for varicose veins include:<br />Age.<br />Being overweight.<br />Being a woman.<br />Not being physically active.<br />Genes.<br />Pregnancy.<br />Smoking.<br />Taking oral contraceptives or hormone replacement.<br /><a href='#collapse2'>How to Prevent Varicose Veins</a><br />Maintaining a healthy weight and exercising regularly can help stop varicose veins from forming. Other ways to prevent them include:<br />Putting up your feet while sitting.<br />Uncrossing your legs while sitting.<br />Wearing compression stockings.<br /><a href='#collapse3'>Spider Veins</a><br />Spider veins are a milder condition caused by the dilation (expansion) of a small group of blood vessels near the surface of your skin. They often look like a sunburst or “spider web,” are red or blue in color and are often found on the face and legs.<br />At this time, no one knows what causes spider veins. However, contributing factors include age, heredity, hormonal changes and pregnancy.<br />",

Also, you may have one of the following diagnostic tests:<br />Duplex Ultrasound<br />An ultrasound that checks the blood flow and structure of your veins.<br />Color-flow Imaging<br />Also called a triplex ultrasound, this procedure is similar to a duplex ultrasound in that is uses color to show the direction of blood flow.<br />Magnetic Resonance Venography (MRV)<br />MRV uses a combination of large magnets and a computer to view your veins. During this test, a dye is injected into your veins for a better view.<br /><a href='#collapse12'>Find Vein Treatment That's Right for You</a><br />We offer both cosmetic and therapeutic treatments for varicose veins, spider veins and other venous-related conditions. Your vascular specialist will work with you to decide which treatments best fit your condition and your lifestyle.<br />Non-Surgical Treatments<br />Compression stockings: elastic stockings that squeeze your veins and prevent blood from pooling. They’re proven to work when worn daily.<br />Minimally Invasive Options<br />Sclerotherapy: the most common treatment for spider and varicose veins. A concentrated saline solution is injected into the veins and then hardens. This causes the veins to close and collapse. Over time, healthy blood vessels will absorb the blood flow.<br />Endovenous laser ablation: removes veins using high-intensity laser beams or intense pulsating light that’s guided by an ultrasound.<br />Phlebectomy: removes your veins using tiny punctures or incisions (cuts) along the path of the vein. Your surgeon then uses a phlebectomy hook (similar to a tiny crochet hook) to remove your veins through these small incisions.<br />Radiofrequency closure ablations: a treatment that can be used instead of vein stripping. A thin catheter is inserted into the vein through a small opening using a single needle stick. The catheter delivers radio frequency energy to the vein, which causes it to heat, collapse and seal shut. Over time, other healthy veins will take over.<br />VenaSeal™ closure system: a new, minimally invasive procedure that uses an advanced medical adhesive to close the diseased vein. VenaSeal™ is designed to minimize patient discomfort and recovery time. It offers many benefits to the patient including no need for anesthesia or compression stockings after the procedure.<br />Clarivein®: a cathether based treatment that uses a rotating tip to disperse medicine and close damaged veins.<br />Varithena®: a cathether based treatment that injects foam into the diseased vein causing it to close or collapse.<br />Surgical Options<br />Vein stripping: an incision is made in your skin to remove or tie off the blood vessel.<br />",

A well-balanced diet that’s high in protein, vitamins and minerals is very important for healthy skin and growing new tissue.<br />If you can’t eat a normal diet or have dietary restrictions, please be sure to talk to your wound care team about it. Your nurse will discuss more details with you about your diet.<br />Watch the video below to learn more about wound care nutrition.<br /><iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/eGcOOHhAzPs?enablejsapi=1'></iframe><br />Fluids<br />Extra fluids are important for normal cell function and healing. Try to drink at least six to eight glasses of water, milk, juice or other fluids every day and limit alcohol and caffeinated beverages. Oral medications can be taken with a full glass of water.<br />Proteins<br />Protein is the building block for new cells and wound repair. It prevents muscle loss. Without enough protein, your body will pull protein from muscle tissue, making you weaker. Eat at least one serving of high protein food, like meat and dairy products, for every meal and snack. Adding protein powder or liquid to food or beverages is another great way to get enough protein.<br />Vitamins and Minerals<br />Your skin needs vitamins and minerals to heal. A diet rich in vitamin C, vitamin E and magnesium is important for the healing process. Your doctor may prescribe a daily vitamin and mineral supplement.<br />",

      "articleContent": "<br />Understanding X-ray<br />General <a href='/services-and-conditions/radiology'>radiology </a>most often refers to diagnostic x-rays used to help identify disease or injury inside the body. X-ray— using radiation passing through the body to produce an image on a special film —was discovered in 1885, and is considered a milestone in the development of modern medicine. For the first time, physicians were able to see inside the body to detect injury and disease, often in its early stages when the illness or injury is most treatable.<br />What to Expect During an X-ray<br />During an x-ray, a machine is used to send x-rays through your body. Radiation is absorbed by the more dense parts of your body, which produces a lighter image on the x-ray picture called a radiograph. The less dense areas of the body (soft tissue) absorb less radiation and appear darker on the x-ray.<br />Common x-ray studies used to detect disease and injury include:<br />Chest Exam - used to diagnose diseases of the heart and lungs<br />Bone Studies - used to determine the relationship between bones and visualize fractures<br />Digestive System Studies - used to detect diseases such as ulcers and tumors.<br />Searching for Foreign Bodies - used to locate objects in the body that should not be there<br />Intravenous Pyelogram (IVP) - Used to study the kidneys and ureters to the bladder.<br />",
