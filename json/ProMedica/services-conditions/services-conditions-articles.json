      "articleContent": "\t\t<h2>Understanding Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm (AAA)</h2>\n\t\t<p>Your aorta is your body’s main blood vessel that runs from your heart through the center of your chest and stomach (abdomen). It’s your body’s main supplier of blood, and a rupture to it can cause life-threatening bleeding.</p>\n\t\t<p>This rupture commonly happens when the aorta’s thick wall is weakened or damaged. It forms a bulge or a balloon, called an aneurysm. Though an aneurysm can occur in any blood vessel, they occur most often in the abdominal (stomach) portion of the aorta. This is called an abdominal aortic aneurysm.</p>\n\t\t<p class=\"pro-callout pro-callout--purple\">Call us today at <a rel=\"tel\" href=\"tel:+18003956278\">1-800-39-JOBST (56278)</a> to schedule an appointment.</p>\n\t\t<h3>What are the symptoms of an abdominal aortic aneurysm?</h3>\n\t\t<p>Though three out of four people show no symptoms, some people feel stomach or low back pain.</p>\n\t\t<h3>Who’s at risk for an abdominal aortic aneurysm?</h3>\n\t\t<ul class=\"standard-list module\">\n\t\t<li>Men over the age&nbsp;of 60 have the highest occurrence.</li>\n\t\t<li>Family history increases your risk.</li>\n\t\t<li>Chances increase if you have <a href=\"/services-and-conditions/high-blood-pressure-hypertension\"><span>high blood pressure.</span></a></li>\n\t\t<li>Risk gets higher if you smoke.</li>\n\t\t<li>Chances increase with age.</li>\n\t\t</ul>\n\t\t<h3>What are my options if I have an abdominal aortic aneurysm?</h3>\n\t\t<p>Your vascular surgeon will recommend specific tests and treatment based on the size of the aneurysm and how fast it’s growing.

This chronic condition causes itchy, inflamed skin that is sometimes accompanied by asthma or allergy symptoms. Although some over-the-counter treatments can be helpful in treating and preventing eczema flare-ups, professional dermatologic care often offers the best results. Our skincare team can help you gain control of your eczema and experience increased confidence and improved quality of life.</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t",

The preclinical stage can last for many years before symptoms appear.</p>\n\t\t<h4>Mild, early stage</h4>\n\t\t<p>Forgetfulness is the most common symptom in the early stage of Alzheimer’s disease, but it’s often misunderstood as a common sign of aging. A person at this stage can still live independently, but may have problems with:</p>\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t<li>Concentration.</li>\n\t\t<li>Making plans.</li>\n\t\t<li>Managing money.</li>\n\t\t<li>Recalling recent events.</li>\n\t\t<li>Remembering a name.</li>\n\t\t<li>Remembering where a valuable object is stored.</li>\n\t\t<li>Staying organized.</li>\n\t\t</ul>\n\t\t<h4>Moderate, middle stage</h4>\n\t\t<p>The middle stage of Alzheimer’s disease is usually the longest stage and can last for many years. At this stage, symptoms can include:</p>\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t<li>Becoming moody or withdrawn, or having personality changes, such as hallucinations, paranoia or delusions.</li>\n\t\t<li>Feeling restless, agitated, anxious or tearful, especially in the late afternoon or at night.</li>\n\t\t<li>Having trouble remembering events.</li>\n\t\t<li>Having trouble remembering names of familiar people, such as a spouse or a child.</li>\n\t\t<li>Losing track of time and place.</li>\n\t\t<li>Needing help with daily activities, such as getting dressed or brushing teeth.</li>\n\t\t<li>Problems learning new things.</li>\n\t\t<li>Problems with reading, writing and working with numbers.</li>\n\t\t<li>Sleep problems.</li>\n\t\t<li>Trouble remembering one’s name, but not details about one’s life, such as address and phone number.</li>\n\t\t<li>Trouble with planning complicated events, like a dinner.</li>\n\t\t</ul>\n\t\t<h4>Severe, late stage</h4>\n\t\t<p>Most people at this stage need around-the-clock caregiving. During this stage of the disease a person may:</p>\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t<li>Be more likely to get infections, especially pneumonia.</li>\n\t\t<li>Be unaware of his or her surroundings.</li>\n\t\t<li>Lose bowel and bladder control.</li>\n\t\t<li>Lose the ability to walk, sit or eat.</li>\n\t\t<li>Need help with activities all of the time.</li>\n\t\t<li>Say some words or phrases but cannot have a conversation.</li>\n\t\t</ul>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t<div class=\"panel panel-default\">\n\t\t<div class=\"panel-heading\" role=\"tab\" id=\"heading4\">\n\t\t<h3 class=\"panel-title\"><a class=\"collapsed\" role=\"button\" data-toggle=\"collapse\" data-parent=\"#accordion\" href=\"#collapse4\" aria-expanded=\"false\" aria-controls=\"collapse4\">Stages of Dementia</a></h3>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t<div id=\"collapse4\" class=\"panel-collapse collapse\" role=\"tabpanel\" aria-labelledby=\"heading4\">\n\t\t<div class=\"panel-body\">\n\t\t<p>There are seven stages of dementia used to describe a person’s progression through the disease that help doctors and caregivers make decisions about treatment.</p>\n\t\t<h4>Stage 1</h4>\n\t\t<p>When a person is in stage 1 dementia, they have no signs of cognitive decline and don’t show any problems with memory.</p>\n\t\t<h4>Stage 2</h4>\n\t\t<p>Although there often aren’t any signs evident during the doctor interview, people in the second stage of dementia may complain about forgetfulness and very mild cognitive decline. Many people with stage 2 dementia are still able to complete tasks and function socially.</p>\n\t\t<h4>Stage 3</h4>\n\t\t<p>A person at this stage has started to show early signs of confusion and family members may start to notice symptoms, including:</p>\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t<li>Memory loss during doctor testing.</li>\n\t\t<li>Some denial about their condition.</li>\n\t\t<li>Trouble remembering names of new people.</li>\n\t\t</ul>\n\t\t<h4>Stage 4</h4>\n\t\t<p>At this stage, a person will continue to show early signs of confusion and problems with cognitive function will become more noticeable. However, most people at this stage are still aware of time and location. Symptoms can include:</p>\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t<li>Being unaware of current and recent events.</li>\n\t\t<li>Problems concentrating.</li>\n\t\t<li>Trouble remembering events from his or her personal history.</li>\n\t\t<li>Using denial as a main defense mechanism when asked about symptoms or problems.</li>\n\t\t</ul>\n\t\t<h4>Stage 5</h4>\n\t\t<p>This stage indicates early dementia. While those with stage 5 dementia may be able to eat and use the bathroom on their own, they start to show signs of moderate to severe cognitive problems, including:</p>\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t<li>Being unable to recall major events in his or her life.</li>\n\t\t<li>Feeling disoriented in time or place.</li>\n\t\t<li>Feeling tearful.</li>\n\t\t<li>Having trouble sleeping.</li>\n\t\t<li>Needing help with choosing what to wear.</li>\n\t\t<li>Occasionally dressing improperly.</li>\n\t\t<li>Resisting the need for caregiving.</li>\n\t\t<li>Wandering around and looking for a way out of the room or building.</li>\n\t\t</ul>\n\t\t<h4>Stage 6</h4>\n\t\t<p>At this stage, a person shows severe cognitive problems and isn’t able to live independently. He or she may:</p>\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t<li>Be unable to recall most recent events.</li>\n\t\t<li>Have problems bathing.</li>\n\t\t<li>Have sleeping problems.</li>\n\t\t<li>Not be able to complete two-step commands.</li>\n\t\t<li>Only eat with assistance.</li>\n\t\t<li>Remove or not wear clothing properly.</li>\n\t\t<li>Repeat conversations.</li>\n\t\t<li>Show great resistance to caregiving.</li>\n\t\t<li>Wander on purpose.</li>\n\t\t</ul>\n\t\t<h4>Stage 7</h4>\n\t\t<p>In the final and most severe stage of dementia, people aren’t able to easily communicate or function on their own, and may:</p>\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t<li>Not be able to complete simple tasks.</li>\n\t\t<li>Not be able to eat on his or her own.</li>\n\t\t<li>Not be able to hold his or her head up.</li>\n\t\t<li>Not be able to sit up or walk independently.</li>\n\t\t<li>Not smile.</li>\n\t\t<li>Speak very little; sometimes as little as one word a day.</li>\n\t\t</ul>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t",

This procedure involves injecting a contrast material (x-ray dye) into a blood vessel to make it visible on an x-ray. The dye is placed directly in the artery through a very small flexible tube called a catheter, which is inserted in to the artery through a small nick in the skin.</p>\n\t\t<p>The procedure is often used to detect abnormalities of the blood vessels, such as narrowing and blockage caused by fatty deposits or blood clots, and aneurysms (defined as weakening or ballooning of the wall of the artery). Angiography can also detect abnormal patterns of blood vessels caused by tumors and can show sites of internal bleeding. Demonstrating these blood vessel abnormalities can help the physician determine the extent of the disease and determine the best treatment option.</p>\n\n\t",

This recognition puts us in the company of fewer than a dozen organizations in the United States to achieve this certification. We meet the highest national standards for quality and safety in asthma diagnosis, treatment and education.</p>\n\t\t<p>Childhood asthma in Lucas County is widespread. It affects 5% of children under the age of five, 15% of children under the age of 11, and 21% of children in grades 6 through 12.

Working directly with affected children and their families, we help them understand and manage their condition. This reduces their risk for emergency room and hospital visits, and improves quality of life. Our patient care program offers a wide spectrum of services and support, including:</p>\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t<li>Controller medicines to decrease symptoms and prevent asthma attacks.</li>\n\t\t<li>Education on personal asthma triggers, such as allergies, smoke, exercise and cold air.</li>\n\t\t<li>How to understand the differences among medicines and how to take the right one at the right time.</li>\n\t\t<li>Personalized Asthma Action Plans to help monitor and manage symptoms and document key healthcare contacts.

While an irregular heartbeat isn’t always dangerous, the side effects can raise your risk for a stroke.</p>\n\t\t<p>During AFib, the electrical signal that starts the heartbeat gets jumbled. This causes the upper chambers of the heart (atria) to contract and relax irregularly. The heart’s upper chambers get out of sync with the lower chambers (ventricles) and the heart can’t pump blood efficiently.</p>\n\t\t<p>When the heart can’t pump blood properly, the blood pools in the upper chambers. At some point, this pooled blood may form a blood clot. If the blood clot escapes the heart and gets stuck in an artery leading to the brain, it can cause a <a href=\"/services-and-conditions/stroke\">stroke</a>.</p>\n\t\t<a href=\"/assets/documents/services-pdfs/afib-fact-sheet.pdf\">Get the facts on AFib with our fact sheet.</a></div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t<div class=\"panel panel-default\">\n\t\t<div class=\"panel-heading\" role=\"tab\" id=\"heading2\">\n\t\t<h3 class=\"panel-title\"><a class=\"collapsed\" role=\"button\" data-toggle=\"collapse\" data-parent=\"#accordion\" href=\"#collapse2\" aria-expanded=\"false\" aria-controls=\"collapse2\">Risk Factors</a></h3>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t<div id=\"collapse2\" class=\"panel-collapse collapse\" role=\"tabpanel\" aria-labelledby=\"heading2\">\n\t\t<div class=\"panel-body\">\n\t\t<p>AFib is more common in women and people over age 65.

      "articleContent": "\t\t<h2>Understanding ADHD</h2>\n\t\t<p>Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common childhood developmental disorders.</p>\n\t\t<p>Typically symptoms start developing before age 7. Children with ADHD may appear overly hyper, compulsive, active or unable to focus. These symptoms create significant challenges in at least two areas of their day-to-day life – home, social settings, school, activities or work (for adults).</p>\n\t\t<p>Remember that everyone matures differently. Behaviors shouldn’t cause concern unless they are more severe or frequent than in other children the same age. Additional factors – personality, temperament, energy or other health conditions – are sometimes mistaken for ADHD. Because of this, careful diagnosis is crucial. The evaluation process typically includes several tests performed by a <a href=\"/find-locations/location-results?LocationText=behavioral%20health\">behavioral health</a> professional.</p>\n\t\t<p>What are the common ADHD symptoms? Signs are grouped into three areas:</p>\n\t\t<h3>Inattention</h3>\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t<li>Easily distracted</li>\n\t\t<li>Does not appear to listen</li>\n\t\t<li>Avoids or dislikes tasks requiring sustained mental effort</li>\n\t\t<li>Struggles to follow through on instructions – especially multiple steps</li>\n\t\t<li>Frequently forgets or misplaces belongings</li>\n\t\t</ul>\n\t\t<h3>Hyperactivity</h3>\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t<li>Has difficulty doing quiet activities</li>\n\t\t<li>Excessively fidgets or talks; squirmy</li>\n\t\t<li>Has difficulty remaining seated</li>\n\t\t<li>Acts as if driven by a motor</li>\n\t\t</ul>\n\t\t<h3>Impulsivity</h3>\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t<li>Blurts out answers before questions have been completed</li>\n\t\t<li>Frequently makes unnecessary mistakes or take risks</li>\n\t\t<li>Interrupts others</li>\n\t\t<li>Has difficulty waiting or taking turns</li>\n\t\t</ul>\n\t\t<hr>\n\t\t<p>What should you do if your think your child has ADHD? Contact your pediatrician to discuss. If further assessment is needed, your pediatrician may recommend evaluation by a licensed behavioral health professional.</p>\n\n\t",

We’re here with answers to your questions about what your child is experiencing. Autism, also known as autism spectrum disorder (ASD), is a developmental disability that causes major social, behavioral and communication problems. It’s a lifelong condition that affects one in 59 children in the United States.</p>\n\t\t<p>ASD describes several different conditions that used to be diagnosed separately, including:</p>\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t<li>Autistic disorder.</li>\n\t\t<li>Pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified (PDD-NOS).</li>\n\t\t<li>Asperger’s syndrome.</li>\n\t\t</ul>\n\t\t<div class=\"panel-group\" id=\"accordion\" role=\"tablist\" aria-multiselectable=\"true\">\n\t\t<div class=\"panel panel-default\">\n\t\t<div class=\"panel-heading\" role=\"tab\" id=\"heading1\">\n\t\t<h3 class=\"panel-title\"><a role=\"button\" data-toggle=\"collapse\" data-parent=\"#accordion\" href=\"#collapse1\" aria-expanded=\"false\" aria-controls=\"collapse1\">Signs of Autism</a></h3>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t<div id=\"collapse1\" class=\"panel-collapse collapse in\" role=\"tabpanel\" aria-labelledby=\"heading1\">\n\t\t<div class=\"panel-body\">\n\t\t<p>You may first notice signs of autism before your child turns three. But they most often appear within the first 12 to 18 months.</p>\n\t\t<p>Remember, autism spectrum disorder affects everyone differently. Symptoms vary from child to child. The most important thing is to talk with your pediatrician about your concerns.</p>\n\t\t<p>Communication problems are often the first signs of autism. A child with autism may not:</p>\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t<li>Babble or respond to his or her name by 10 months.</li>\n\t\t<li>Be soothed by mom’s voice by three months.</li>\n\t\t<li>Follow simple spoken directions.</li>\n\t\t<li>Give big smiles by six months.</li>\n\t\t<li>Imitate simple words or sounds by 15 months.</li>\n\t\t<li>Locate objects when asked by 15 months.</li>\n\t\t<li>Make eye contact.</li>\n\t\t<li>Seem startled by loud sounds by three months.</li>\n\t\t<li>Understand common words such as “no” or “bye-bye.”</li>\n\t\t<li>Want to be with other people.</li>\n\t\t</ul>\n\t\t<p>Along with having communication problems, a child with autism may:</p>\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t<li>Arch his or her back or make other unusual body movements.</li>\n\t\t<li>Be extremely irritable.</li>\n\t\t<li>Frequently choke or gag.</li>\n\t\t<li>Have a floppy or limp body.</li>\n\t\t<li>Have stiff arms or legs.</li>\n\t\t<li>Make minimal gestures — such as pointing, reaching and waving — by 12 months.</li>\n\t\t<li>Only use one side of the body.</li>\n\t\t</ul>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t<div class=\"panel panel-default\">\n\t\t<div class=\"panel-heading\" role=\"tab\" id=\"heading2\">\n\t\t<h3 class=\"panel-title\"><a class=\"collapsed\" role=\"button\" data-toggle=\"collapse\" data-parent=\"#accordion\" href=\"#collapse2\" aria-expanded=\"false\" aria-controls=\"collapse2\">Risk Factors</a></h3>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t<div id=\"collapse2\" class=\"panel-collapse collapse\" role=\"tabpanel\" aria-labelledby=\"heading2\">\n\t\t<div class=\"panel-body\">\n\t\t<p>Autism can affect children of all races, ethnic groups, education levels and incomes.

These specialists can include:</p>\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t<li>Child psychiatrist or psychologists.</li>\n\t\t<li>Developmental pediatricians.</li>\n\t\t<li>Occupational therapists.</li>\n\t\t<li>Pediatric neurologists.</li>\n\t\t<li>Speech and language therapists.</li>\n\t\t</ul>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t<div class=\"panel panel-default\">\n\t\t<div class=\"panel-heading\" role=\"tab\" id=\"heading4\">\n\t\t<h3 class=\"panel-title\"><a class=\"collapsed\" role=\"button\" data-toggle=\"collapse\" data-parent=\"#accordion\" href=\"#collapse4\" aria-expanded=\"false\" aria-controls=\"collapse4\">Treatment</a></h3>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t<div id=\"collapse4\" class=\"panel-collapse collapse\" role=\"tabpanel\" aria-labelledby=\"heading4\">\n\t\t<div class=\"panel-body\">\n\t\t<p>While there’s no single treatment or medicine that can cure autism, there’s hope and help.

As in, people see a major improvement in their overall health and well-being. But weight loss surgery offers many other health benefits that can help you lead a longer, happier life.</p>\n\t\t<p>Benefits of weight loss surgery include:</p>\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t<li>Better mood and self-esteem.</li>\n\t\t<li>Enhanced fertility in younger women.</li>\n\t\t<li>Less pain related to osteoarthritis.</li>\n\t\t<li>Lowered risk of heart disease.</li>\n\t\t<li>Much lower blood pressure and cholesterol levels.</li>\n\t\t<li>Reduced risk of breast and colon cancer.</li>\n\t\t<li>Relief from acid reflux and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD).</li>\n\t\t<li>Resolved sleep apnea and respiratory issues.</li>\n\t\t</ul>\n\t\t<h4>Diabetes Management</h4>\n\t\t<p>Weight loss surgery can have major, life-changing effects, especially for those with type 2 diabetes. Weight loss can not only help prevent the onset of diabetes, but it can even reverse the condition. About 84% of patients report remission of their diabetes after surgery. Other people typically need less medicine to control their condition.</p>\n\t\t<p>So how does bariatric surgery help diabetes? Weight loss surgery limits your food intake. The small intestine is rerouted slightly, which redirects the digestive process. The result is that your body absorbs fewer calories.

Endorsed by the American Society of Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery in 2019, the surgery works in three ways.</p>\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t<li>The sleeve gastrectomy portion of this surgery creates a 2-3 oz small stomach and as a result, a person cannot eat much.</li>\n\t\t<li>Food will move from the new small stomach directly into the lower 10 feet of the small intestine and bypass the first part of the small intestine, which is about half of the small intestine. Normally, the small intestine that is available to absorb calories and nutrients is around 15 to 25 feet long. The result is that less of the calories are absorbed.</li>\n\t\t</ul>\n\t\t<p>Additional Facts about the SADI-S:</p>\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t<li>The sleeve gastrectomy portion of this surgery creates a 2-3 oz small stomach and as a result, a person cannot eat much.</li>\n\t\t<li>Food will move from the new small stomach directly into the lower 10 feet of the small intestine and bypass the first part of the small intestine, which is about half of the small intestine.

The result is that less of the calories are absorbed.</li>\n\t\t</ul>\n\t\t<h4>Revision Surgery</h4>\n\t\t<p>Bariatric Revision Surgery is a procedure that corrects or improves prior weight loss surgery. Most of the time, bariatric surgery is successful. However, it may be recommended for you if you’ve experienced:</p>\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t<li>Inadequate Weight Loss</li>\n\t\t<li>Weight re-gain</li>\n\t\t<li>Ruptured or displaced gastric bands</li>\n\t\t<li>Displaced gastric band ports</li>\n\t\t<li>Disrupted staples</li>\n\t\t<li>Enlarged gastric pouch</li>\n\t\t<li>Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD)</li>\n\t\t<li>Problems swallowing</li>\n\t\t</ul>\n\t\t<h4>Bariatric Revision Surgery Options</h4>\n\t\t<p>At ProMedica Weight Loss Surgery, we use the latest minimally invasive technology, including robotic assisted surgery, to perform bariatric revision surgery. We offer several revision procedures, including:</p>\n\t\t<h4>Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass Revision</h4>\n\t\t<p>The original gastric pouch created during surgery may become larger over time. This procedure involves the following:</p>\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t<li>Increase intestinal bypass</li>\n\t\t<li>Decrease pouch and stomach size</li>\n\t\t</ul>\n\t\t<h4>Gastric Sleeve Resection</h4>\n\t\t<p>We can correct gastric sleeve surgery by:</p>\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t<li>Converting the gastric sleeve to a gastric bypass</li>\n\t\t<li>Recreating the gastric sleeve</li>\n\t\t<li>Changing the gastric sleeve to duodenal switch</li>\n\t\t</ul>\n\t\t<p>When a patient undergoes a revision to his or her gastric bypass, we usually see a 65-75% excess body weight loss, which is 65-70 lbs. weight loss for every 100 pounds. If a patient has a small stomach pouch which cannot be revised, weight loss is usually 50-55 lbs. for every 100 lbs. of excess body weight.</p>\n\t\t<p>Insurers all have different requirements, but they generally cover revisions to the sleeve or bypass to address weight regain, if you meet these criteria: <strong>If your BMI is greater than 40, or if you have a BMI of 35 along with a medical problem related to obesity</strong></p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t<div class=\"panel panel-default\">\n\t\t<div class=\"panel-heading\" role=\"tab\" id=\"heading8\">\n\t\t<h3 class=\"panel-title\"><a class=\"collapsed\" role=\"button\" data-toggle=\"collapse\" data-parent=\"#accordion2\" href=\"#collapse8\" aria-expanded=\"false\" aria-controls=\"collapse8\">What to Expect Before Surgery</a></h3>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t<div id=\"collapse8\" class=\"panel-collapse collapse\" role=\"tabpanel\" aria-labelledby=\"heading8\">\n\t\t<div class=\"panel-body\">\n\t\t<p>The first step in our program is to see if weight loss surgery is the right choice for you. We want all of our patients to achieve lifelong health, which is why we’ll only recommend surgery if we believe you’re a good candidate.</p>\n\t\t<p></p>\n\t\tWe look at a variety of factors, including your:\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t<li><strong>Age:</strong> You must be between the ages of 18 and 67.</li>\n\t\t<li><strong>Lifestyle and health:</strong> You must stop smoking at least three months before your weight loss surgery and agree not to smoke after surgery. You should also commit to exercising and eating a healthy diet after surgery. These are essential to help keep the weight off for good.</li>\n\t\t<li><strong>Personality:</strong> You must be motivated to make a real change in your health. The ideal candidate for weight loss surgery is willing to face the physical, emotional and social changes that come with weight loss.</li>\n\t\t<li><strong>Weight:</strong> You must have a body mass index (BMI) of 40 or more (about 100 pounds or more over ideal body weight). Or have a BMI of 35 to 39.9 with serious medical conditions related to obesity that would improve with weight loss.</li>\n\t\t</ul>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t<div class=\"panel panel-default\">\n\t\t<div class=\"panel-heading\" role=\"tab\" id=\"heading9\">\n\t\t<h3 class=\"panel-title\"><a class=\"collapsed\" role=\"button\" data-toggle=\"collapse\" data-parent=\"#accordion2\" href=\"#collapse9\" aria-expanded=\"false\" aria-controls=\"collapse9\">What to Expect After Surgery</a></h3>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t<div id=\"collapse9\" class=\"panel-collapse collapse\" role=\"tabpanel\" aria-labelledby=\"heading9\">\n\t\t<div class=\"panel-body\">\n\t\t<p>Part of the bariatric surgery journey is for you to commit to healthier lifestyle changes. These include your diet and eating habits. This will be one of the biggest changes you’ll need to make after surgery.</p>\n\t\t<p>Our bariatric dietitians will help you understand the dietary and nutritional changes to expect in the days and weeks after your weight loss surgery. We’ll support you through every step and guide you through meal options, food choices and more.</p>\n\t\t<p>Right after surgery, your digestive system will need to rest and heal for a couple of days. You’ll begin a liquid diet of light broths and beverages while you’re still in the hospital.</p>\n\t\t<p>After a few days of the liquid diet, you’ll move to pureed foods like lean meats, beans, yogurt and egg whites. You’ll eat pureed foods for a few weeks when you go home.</p>\n\t\t<p>Once your body is comfortable with pureed foods, you’ll begin eating soft, solid foods like ground meats, soft fruits and cooked vegetables. You’ll continue to get support and menu ideas from your dietitian and bariatric care team for two to three months.</p>\n\t\t<p>Eventually, your doctor will transition you back to enjoying solid, healthy foods.</p>\n\t\t<p>After surgery, your body doesn’t absorb nutrients the way it used to. That’s why it’s important to take nutritional supplements. Supplements help make sure you’re getting all the nutrients you need. You can get supplements specially made for weight-loss surgery patients at our pharmacy partner, Pharmacy Counter.</p>\n\t\t<h4>Ideas for Cooking at Home</h4>\n\t\t<p>Once you return to eating solid food, there are many well-balanced meal choices.

      "articleContent": "\n\t\t<h2>Understanding Bipolar Disorder</h2>\n\t\t<p>Bipolar disorder is a mental disorder that causes identifiable and sometimes intense changes in mood and energy level. Someone with bipolar disorder may experience periods of high energy (manic periods) followed by periods of depression or lethargy (depressive periods). The exact cause is unknown, but research suggests that it is hereditary, as it often runs in families. Studies are still underway to try and identify which gene (or genes) may be responsible.</p>\n\t\t<h3>Signs of Bipolar Disorder</h3>\n\t\t<p>Someone with bipolar disorder will experience both types of the following symptoms to a varying degree:</p>\n\t\t<h4>Manic symptoms:</h4>\n\t\t<ul class=\"module standard-list\">\n\t\t<li>Has an overly inflated sense of self-esteem</li>\n\t\t<li>Seems to not need sleep or rest as much</li>\n\t\t<li>Is very distracted and irritable</li>\n\t\t<li>Excessively gets involved in high-risk and/or pleasurable activities, for example: sexual promiscuity, reckless driving, reckless spending, substance abuse</li>\n\t\t<li>Enhanced talkativeness</li>\n\t\t<li>Appears to have excessive “high” or euphoric feelings, grandiose at times</li>\n\t\t<li>Unpredictably changes mood from happy or silly, anger or agitation</li>\n\t\t<li>Increased sex drive</li>\n\t\t<li>Increased energy level</li>\n\t\t<li>Uses uncharacteristic poor judgment</li>\n\t\t</ul>\n\t\t<h4>Depressive symptoms:</h4>\n\t\t<ul class=\"module standard-list\">\n\t\t<li>Difficulty with relationships</li>\n\t\t<li>Expresses excessive guilt</li>\n\t\t<li>Expresses hopelessness</li>\n\t\t<li>Is extremely sensitive to failure or rejection</li>\n\t\t<li>Is unable to concentrate</li>\n\t\t<li>Lacks energy</li>\n\t\t<li>Lacks interest in activities once enjoyed</li>\n\t\t<li>Persistently suffers sadness</li>\n\t\t<li>Seems irritable, hostile or aggressive</li>\n\t\t<li>Shares feelings of wanting to die</li>\n\t\t<li>Shows changes in appetite or weight</li>\n\t\t<li>Shows signs of low self-esteem</li>\n\t\t<li>Sleeps too much or very little</li>\n\t\t<li>Thinks about suicide or attempts suicide</li>\n\t\t</ul>\n\t\t<p>If you think you may have bipolar disorder, talk to your primary care doctor. After ruling out other conditions through a physical exam, they can help you find a psychiatrist, psychologist or other behavioral health specialist with experience in treating bipolar disorder.</p>\n\t\t<h3>Bipolar Disorder in Children and Adolescents</h3>\n\t\t<p>Bipolar disorder is a condition with alternating sets of symptoms. During certain periods of time, your child or adolescent may act extremely happy, elated, or very irritable (manic symptoms). During the alternate periods of time they will exhibit symptoms of <a href=\"/services-and-conditions/depression\">major depression.</a></p>\n\t\t<p>When symptoms are present before age 12, they are sometimes confused with <a href=\"/services-and-conditions/attention-defecit-hyperactivity-disorder-adhd\">attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)</a>. However, advances continue to be made in recognizing bipolar disorder in younger children.</p>\n\t\t<p>If you believe your child has bipolar disorder, contact your pediatrician or family doctor to set up an appointment for evaluation. If further assessment is needed, your doctor may recommend evaluation by a licensed behavioral health professional. Bipolar disorder can be effectively treated, usually with a combination of therapy and medication.</p>\n\t",

These include your age, the size and location of the aneurysm and your overall health and medical history.</p>\n\t\t<p>Our brain aneurysm clinic at <a href=\"/location/promedica-toledo-hospital-1\">ProMedica Toledo Hospital</a> uses a patient-centered and multi-disciplinary approach. The clinic provides patients with access to both a cerebrovascular neurosurgeon and an interventional vascular neurologist during the same clinic encounter. That means patients and their families can talk with both doctors about the jointly developed plan to manage the patient’s brain aneurysm. We offer a wide-range of treatment options including surgical clipping, endovascular coiling, flow diversion and observation with follow-up imaging.</p>\n\t\t<h3>Surgical Treatments</h3>\n\t\t<p>It’s our goal to treat you with minimally invasive methods whenever we can. They include medicines and minimally invasive therapies. But sometimes surgery is needed. Your specialist may advise surgery if the aneurysm is in danger of rupturing. There are three primary surgical treatments for a brain aneurysm:</p>\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t<li><strong>Endovascular coiling:</strong> Also called coil embolization, endovascular coiling is a minimally invasive method. This means an incision (cut) in the skull is not needed to treat the cerebral aneurysm.</li>\n\t\t<li><strong>Open craniotomy (surgical clipping):</strong> This procedure uses surgery to remove part of the skull.</li>\n\t\t<li><strong>Woven Endobridge (WEB) Aneurysm Embolization System:</strong> Called The Web, this device is used for treating complex brain aneurysms. In 2019, ProMedica became the first regional center in northern Ohio and Michigan to offer a this new, cutting-edge treatment for brain aneurysms. The device offers patients with complex brain aneurysms a treatment that is less risky and less difficult than previous endovascular therapy.</li>\n\t\t</ul>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t",

Some are formed inside the brain (glioma). Other tumors start as cancer somewhere else in the body and then land in the brain (metastatic). There are also tumors that grow on the outside surface of the brain and create pressure (meningioma). Every type of brain tumor has many levels of severity and there are different treatments for each type.</p>\n\t\t<p>It’s important to know the risks for developing a brain tumor, especially if you have a family history. Many times, these symptoms may appear: new or changing headaches, seizures, hearing or vision loss, fatigue and cognitive issues. But the type, size and location of a tumor can also dictate the kinds of symptoms you have. If you have any concerns, please talk about them with your family doctor.</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t",

You and your doctor have decided a breast biopsy is the best choice. One such biopsy type is an image guided breast biopsy. Be assured in our prompt, efficient service so you can know; the sooner the better.</p>\n\t\t<h3>What is an image guided breast biopsy?</h3>\n\t\t<p>It’s an office procedure that’s minimally invasive, which means it doesn’t involve surgery, requires very little time to perform, and results in minimal discomfort for you.</p>\n\t\t<p>It gives your radiologist greater visibility and greater accuracy to reach the part of your breast that may be in question. It requires a local anesthetic, a nick in your skin, and a small, ultrasound-guided tool to navigate the area.</p>\n\t\t<h3>What are the benefits of image guided breast biopsy over conventional biopsies?</h3>\n\t\t<p>The common benefits to you are:</p>\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t<li>Less discomfort</li>\n\t\t<li>Fewer after-effects</li>\n\t\t<li>A smaller incision</li>\n\t\t</ul>\n\t\t<h3>Is image guided breast biopsy the best choice for you?</h3>\n\t\t<p>This is a decision for you and your doctor.

However, if any of the following risk factors also apply to you, your doctor may recommend that you have mammograms earlier or more often:</p>\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t<li>Increased age.</li>\n\t\t<li>Obesity.</li>\n\t\t<li>Personal or a family history of breast cancer.</li>\n\t\t<li>Prior radiation treatment to the chest.</li>\n\t\t<li>Tobacco or alcohol use, or both.</li>\n\t\t</ul>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t<div class=\"panel panel-default\">\n\t\t<div class=\"panel-heading\" role=\"tab\" id=\"heading2\">\n\t\t<h3 class=\"panel-title\"><a class=\"collapsed\" role=\"button\" data-toggle=\"collapse\" data-parent=\"#accordion\" href=\"#collapse2\" aria-expanded=\"false\" aria-controls=\"collapse2\">Breast Cancer Signs</a></h3>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t<div id=\"collapse2\" class=\"panel-collapse collapse\" role=\"tabpanel\" aria-labelledby=\"heading2\">\n\t\t<div class=\"panel-body\">\n\t\t<p>Often, the first sign of breast cancer is a lump or a change in the feel of the breast. But there are other symptoms that may alert your doctor to possible breast cancer and the need for a mammogram. These include:</p>\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t<li>Changes in the nipple.</li>\n\t\t<li>Itchy or irritated breast.</li>\n\t\t<li>Nipple discharge.</li>\n\t\t<li>Pain in the breast.</li>\n\t\t<li>Redness or color changes in the breast.</li>\n\t\t<li>Swelling of the breast.</li>\n\t\t</ul>\n\t\t<p class=\"pro-callout pro-callout--purple\">Detecting cancer early can increase your chances for recovery and may even save your life.

These include breast self-exams, clinical breast exams and mammograms. Your doctor will recommend the exams that are right for you, based on your age and risk factors.</p>\n\t\t<h4>Breast Self-Exams</h4>\n\t\t<p>A breast self-exam is a check-up you can do at home to look for changes or problems in the breast tissue. Your doctor may recommend that you include a monthly self-exam as part of your wellness routine. If so, your doctor will give you instructions on how to do a breast self-exam.</p>\n\t\t<h4>Clinical Breast Exams</h4>\n\t\t<p>Starting in your 20s and 30s, your doctor will include a clinical breast exam as part of your regular well-woman visit. The exam will be done at least every three years.</p>\n\t\t<h4>Mammograms</h4>\n\t\t<p><a href=\"/services-and-conditions/mammography\">Mammograms</a> can find a change in your breasts before you can feel it.

At ProMedica Breast Care and our locations across the ProMedica system, we offer specialized diagnostic tests.

Because of that, sometimes we need to combine several tests to get a complete picture of your breast health.</p>\n\t\t<p>The screening process can seem confusing and cause anxiety for many women. We strive to guide you through the screening process as quickly and easily as possible. If your exam is diagnostic, we may offer an ultrasound or biopsy that same day if needed to speed up the process of getting a diagnosis. MRIs and MBIs will likely be scheduled out as they must coincide with your menstrual cycle. Here are the screening steps you might expect when you come to ProMedica for breast care:</p>\n\t\t<ol>\n\t\t<li>Clinical breast exam.</li>\n\t\t<li>Mammogram to detect abnormalities in breast tissue.</li>\n\t\t<li>Ultrasound to learn if the mass is a cyst or tumor.</li>\n\t\t<li><a href=\"/services-and-conditions/breast-biopsy\">Biopsy</a> for lab evaluation.</li>\n\t\t<li>Another mammogram to confirm the biopsy was in the right place.</li>\n\t\t<li><a href=\"/services-and-conditions/breast-mri\">MRI</a> or <a href=\"/services-and-conditions/molecular-breast-imaging\">MBI</a> if the biopsy is positive for cancer.</li>\n\t\t<li>Breast cancer treatment begins.</li>\n\t\t</ol>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t",

Then they will recommend a course of treatments that may be used separately or together in your care plan.</p>\n\t\t<h4>Chemotherapy</h4>\n\t\t<p><a href=\"/services-and-conditions/chemotherapy\">Chemotherapy</a> for breast cancer treatment may be given before or after surgery, and also when breast cancer has spread to other areas of the body. It is given through an IV.</p>\n\t\t<h4>Biotherapy (or Immunology)</h4>\n\t\t<p>Biotherapy, also referred to as immunotherapy, uses your own body’s immune system to help fight the cancer.</p>\n\t\t<h4>Hormone Therapy</h4>\n\t\t<p>Hormone therapy blocks hormones that are causing the breast cancer to grow. It’s used for hormone receptor positive breast cancers.</p>\n\t\t<h4>Radiation</h4>\n\t\t<p><a href=\"/services-and-conditions/radiation-therapy\">Radiation therapy</a> for breast cancer uses high energy X-rays to shrink and kill cancer cells. It’s usually given after surgery or chemotherapy to reduce the risk of the cancer coming back.</p>\n\t\t<h4>Surgery</h4>\n\t\t<p>Surgical treatment is used to remove the cancer and possibly the lymph nodes and healthy tissue around the cancer. Types of surgical treatments for breast cancer include lumpectomy and mastectomy.</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t<div class=\"panel panel-default\">\n\t\t<div class=\"panel-heading\" role=\"tab\" id=\"heading7\">\n\t\t<h3 class=\"panel-title\"><a class=\"collapsed\" role=\"button\" data-toggle=\"collapse\" data-parent=\"#accordion2\" href=\"#collapse7\" aria-expanded=\"false\" aria-controls=\"collapse7\">A Surgeon Dedicated to Breast Oncology</a></h3>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t<div id=\"collapse7\" class=\"panel-collapse collapse\" role=\"tabpanel\" aria-labelledby=\"heading7\">\n\t\t<div class=\"panel-body\">\n\t\t<p>Jessica Burns, MD, is the region’s only fellowship-trained surgeon in breast oncology.

Your care team will provide updates to your family throughout your surgery and into recovery.</p>\n\t\t<p>After surgery, your family members and loved ones will be able to visit you in the intensive care unit (ICU). Once recovery milestones have been met, you will be transferred from the ICU to a step-down unit.</p>\n\t\t<p>As you continue to recover in the hospital, your care team will help you:</p>\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t<li>Eat more.</li>\n\t\t<li>Manage pain.</li>\n\t\t<li>Move more.</li>\n\t\t</ul>\n\t\t<p>You should be ready to go home from the hospital three to five days after surgery.

If you’re diagnosed with this disease, it means a fatty deposit (plaque) has built up in one or both of the carotid arteries and this plaque is restricting blood flow to your brain.

Your healthcare provider can help you choose the best exam schedule for you. The doctor can also recommend any added testing or screening for you, based on your unique history and needs. Talk with your doctor about scheduling a screening.</p>\n\t\t<p>Your recommended screenings may include:</p>\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t<li><strong>Pelvic exams:</strong> Typically, a pelvic exam is the first step in diagnosing gynecologic cancers. During a pelvic exam, your doctor will be able to note changes in the size or shape of your cervix.</li>\n\t\t<li><strong>Pap tests:</strong> Cell changes on the cervix called precancers can become cervical cancer if they aren’t treated. A Pap test, also sometimes called a Pap smear, can help your doctor test for these cell changes.</li>\n\t\t<li><strong> Colposcopy:</strong> If the results of your Pap test are abnormal, your doctor will recommend a procedure called a colposcopy. This lets your doctor examine the surface of your cervix to find any abnormal areas.</li>\n\t\t<li><strong>Biopsy:</strong> If an abnormal area is seen during a colposcopy, a biopsy will be done to learn if it’s cancer.</li>\n\t\t<li><strong>HPV tests:</strong> These tests let you know whether or not you have HPV, which can produce cancerous cells.

What is chemotherapy? It’s the use of medications to treat cancer. Depending on the cancer type and its stage, chemotherapy is used to treat cancer, keep it from spreading, slow its cell growth, or to relieve its symptoms.</p>\n\t\t<p>Chemotherapy, commonly referred to as chemo, destroys cancer cells and stops them from growing or multiplying. Chemotherapy can be used along with radiation therapy, surgery, or both.</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"panel-group\" role=\"tablist\" aria-multiselectable=\"true\">\n\t\t<div class=\"panel panel-default\">\n\t\t<div class=\"panel-heading\" role=\"tab\" id=\"heading1\">\n\t\t<h3 class=\"panel-title\"><a class=\"collapsed\" role=\"button\" data-toggle=\"collapse\" data-parent=\"#accordion\" href=\"#faq1\" aria-expanded=\"false\" aria-controls=\"faq1\">How is chemotherapy given?</a></h3>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t<div id=\"faq1\" class=\"panel-collapse collapse\" role=\"tabpanel\" aria-labelledby=\"heading1\" aria-expanded=\"false\">\n\t\t<div class=\"panel-body\">\n\t\t<p>You may be treated in your doctor’s office, a clinic in the hospital, or at home. Some common methods include:</p>\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t<li>Intravenous (through your veins)</li>\n\t\t<li>Oral (by mouth)</li>\n\t\t<li>Intramuscular (injected deep into the muscle)</li>\n\t\t<li>Intrathecal (injected into the spinal canal)</li>\n\t\t</ul>\n\t\t<p>Sometimes, a more permanent catheter type is recommended to avoid repeated painful needle sticks into your vein. These permanent catheters are called “central venous catheters” and are placed under your skin’s surface. Chemotherapy, blood, and IV fluids can be given through this catheter, and blood for lab tests can be drawn from this site.</p>\n\t\t<p>An implantable port can also be used to deliver chemotherapy. It’s round in shape and is usually surgically inserted under your skin surface on the chest wall between your neck and shoulder. To use the port, the nurse will insert a needle through your skin surface to access it.</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t<div class=\"panel panel-default\">\n\t\t<div class=\"panel-heading\" role=\"tab\" id=\"heading2\">\n\t\t<h3 class=\"panel-title\"><a class=\"collapsed\" role=\"button\" data-toggle=\"collapse\" data-parent=\"#accordion\" href=\"#faq2\" aria-expanded=\"false\" aria-controls=\"faq2\">How long does chemotherapy treatment last?</a></h3>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t<div id=\"faq2\" class=\"panel-collapse collapse\" role=\"tabpanel\" aria-labelledby=\"heading2\" aria-expanded=\"false\">\n\t\t<div class=\"panel-body\">\n\t\t<p>Your dosage schedule is individualized to your treatment plan.

There are also major differences between the causes, diagnoses and treatments for childhood cancers and those for adult cancers.</p>\n\t\t<p>One of the biggest differences between childhood cancer and adult cancer is the survival rate. Childhood cancers usually have better outcomes. Doctors believe this is because childhood cancers respond better to treatment. Children can also tolerate more aggressive therapy.</p>\n\t\t<p>Survival rates for childhood cancer depend on the child’s age, diagnosis and cancer type.</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"panel-group\" id=\"accordion2\" role=\"tablist\" aria-multiselectable=\"true\">\n\t\t<div class=\"panel panel-default\">\n\t\t<div class=\"panel-heading\" role=\"tab\" id=\"heading4\">\n\t\t<h3 class=\"panel-title\"><a class=\"collapsed\" role=\"button\" data-toggle=\"collapse\" data-parent=\"#accordion2\" href=\"#collapse4\" aria-expanded=\"false\" aria-controls=\"collapse4\">Types of Childhood Cancer</a></h3>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t<div id=\"collapse4\" class=\"panel-collapse\" role=\"tabpanel\" aria-labelledby=\"heading4\">\n\t\t<div class=\"panel-body\">\n\t\t<h4>Brain and Spinal Cord Tumors</h4>\n\t\t<p>There are many different kinds of brain and spinal cord tumors. Brain tumors tend to be more common than spine tumors.</p>\n\t\t<p>Childhood brain tumors usually start in the lower part of the brain.</p>\n\t\t<p>Brain and spine tumor symptoms may include:</p>\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t<li>Blurred or double vision.</li>\n\t\t<li>Clumsiness.</li>\n\t\t<li>Dizziness.</li>\n\t\t<li>Nausea and vomiting.</li>\n\t\t<li>Stumbling or falling.</li>\n\t\t</ul>\n\t\t<h4>Leukemia</h4>\n\t\t<p>Leukemia is a blood and bone marrow cancer. It’s the most common type of childhood cancer.</p>\n\t\t<p>Leukemia symptoms may include:</p>\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t<li>Bleeding or bruising.</li>\n\t\t<li>Bone and joint pain.</li>\n\t\t<li>Fatigue.</li>\n\t\t<li>Fever.</li>\n\t\t<li>Pale skin.</li>\n\t\t<li>Weakness.</li>\n\t\t<li>Weight loss.</li>\n\t\t</ul>\n\t\t<h4>Lymphoma</h4>\n\t\t<p>Lymphoma starts in immune system cells. These cells are called lymphocytes. Lymphomas usually grow in the lymph nodes or parts of the lymph system, such as the tonsils or thymus gland.</p>\n\t\t<p>Lymphoma can sometimes travel to the bone marrow or other organs. This is because the lymph system carries fluid all through the body.</p>\n\t\t<p>There are two types of childhood lymphoma. The type depends on which kind of lymphocyte is affected by the cancer. Each type of lymphoma has a different treatment.</p>\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t<li><strong>Hodgkin lymphoma</strong>. This type of lymphoma is usually found in teenagers. Sometimes it can be found in children under five.</li>\n\t\t<li><strong>Non-Hodgkin lymphoma</strong>. This type of lymphoma grows quickly. However, it responds well to treatment. It’s usually diagnosed in young children, but rarely before age three.</li>\n\t\t</ul>\n\t\t<p>Common lymphoma symptoms may include:</p>\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t<li>Fatigue.</li>\n\t\t<li>Fever.</li>\n\t\t<li>Sweating.</li>\n\t\t<li>Swollen glands or lumps in the armpits, neck or groin.</li>\n\t\t<li>Weight loss.</li>\n\t\t</ul>\n\t\t<h4>Neuroblastoma</h4>\n\t\t<p>Neuroblastoma is cancer that affects the nerve cells. It usually affects infants and young children because it starts forming before birth in the fetus’ or embryo’s nerve cells.</p>\n\t\t<p>Symptoms of neuroblastoma may include:</p>\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t<li>Bone pain.</li>\n\t\t<li>Fever.</li>\n\t\t<li>Swelling or a lump around the stomach.</li>\n\t\t</ul>\n\t\t<h4>Wilms Tumor</h4>\n\t\t<p>A Wilms tumor starts in one of the kidneys. This cancer usually affects children between ages three and four.</p>\n\t\t<p>Common Wilms tumor symptoms may include:</p>\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t<li>Fever.</li>\n\t\t<li>Loss of appetite.</li>\n\t\t<li>Nausea.</li>\n\t\t<li>Pain.</li>\n\t\t<li>Swelling or a lump around the stomach.</li>\n\t\t</ul>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t<div class=\"panel panel-default\">\n\t\t<div class=\"panel-heading\" role=\"tab\" id=\"heading5\">\n\t\t<h3 class=\"panel-title\"><a class=\"collapsed\" role=\"button\" data-toggle=\"collapse\" data-parent=\"#accordion2\" href=\"#collapse5\" aria-expanded=\"false\" aria-controls=\"collapse5\">Risk Factors for Childhood Cancer</a></h3>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t<div id=\"collapse5\" class=\"panel-collapse collapse\" role=\"tabpanel\" aria-labelledby=\"heading5\">\n\t\t<div class=\"panel-body\">\n\t\t<p>While doctors don’t know exactly what causes childhood cancer, risk factors may include:</p>\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t<li>Environmental factors, such as exposure to radiation.</li>\n\t\t<li>Genetic changes.</li>\n\t\t<li>Personal or family history of cancer.</li>\n\t\t</ul>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t<div class=\"panel panel-default\">\n\t\t<div class=\"panel-heading\" role=\"tab\" id=\"heading6\">\n\t\t<h3 class=\"panel-title\"><a class=\"collapsed\" role=\"button\" data-toggle=\"collapse\" data-parent=\"#accordion2\" href=\"#collapse6\" aria-expanded=\"false\" aria-controls=\"collapse6\">Diagnosing Childhood Cancers</a></h3>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t<div id=\"collapse6\" class=\"panel-collapse collapse\" role=\"tabpanel\" aria-labelledby=\"heading6\">\n\t\t<div class=\"panel-body\">\n\t\t<p>At ProMedica, we have access to advanced testing that can diagnose childhood cancer.

This treatment is given in the veins (intravenously). It prevents cancer cells from growing by killing the cells or stopping the cells from dividing. Chemotherapy may be given before or after surgery. This treatment is also used if cancer has spread to other parts of the body.</li>\n\t\t<li><strong><a href=\"/services-and-conditions/radiation-therapy\">Radiation therapy</a></strong> [Link to ‘Understanding Radiation Therapy’ page]. This treatment uses high-energy X-rays to shrink and kill cancer cells.

Chromosomes (small “groups” of genes) in the body determine how a baby grows and functions after birth. Minor changes in these genes can greatly affect body and brain development.</p>\n\t\t<h3>Down Syndrome</h3>\n\t\t<p>Down syndrome affects about 1 out of every 700 babies born. The condition occurs when a baby develops in the womb with one extra copy of chromosome 21.</p>\n\t\t<p>Down syndrome is normally tested for during pregnancy, or right after birth, to allow parents time to prepare for a baby requiring special needs.</p>\n\t\t<p>While people with Down syndrome share similar physical traits, each individual has different abilities. They typically experience intellectual and physical challenges, but can reach full and productive lives with the support of speech, occupational and physical therapy.</p>\n\t\t<h3>Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS)</h3>\n\t\t<p>FAS can occur when a pregnant mother drinks alcohol, passing it through the umbilical cord to their baby.</p>\n\t\t<p>Alcohol exposure can prevent a baby from developing properly in the womb. There is no measure for a “safe” amount of alcohol to drink during pregnancy. Zero consumption is recommended.</p>\n\t\t<p>Children born with FAS may have abnormal facial features, experience stunted growth and central nervous system problems. In addition, many people experience trouble with learning, speech, sight, and hearing throughout their lives.</p>\n\t\t<p>There is no cure for FAS, but early treatment and ongoing support can help a child reach their full potential.</p>\n\t\t<p>Treatment factors:</p>\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t<li>Early diagnosis (before age 6)</li>\n\t\t<li>Stable home environment</li>\n\t\t<li>Absence of violence</li>\n\t\t<li>Special education and social services</li>\n\t\t</ul>\n\t\t<p class=\"pro-callout pro-callout--purple\">Our multidisciplinary team of physicians and behavioral health specialists can help your child reach their individual potential.</p>\n\t",

Most colorectal cancers start as small bumps, called polyps, in the lining of your colon or rectum.</p>\n\t\t<p>Some polyps can turn into cancer. Colorectal cancer is the third most common cancer diagnosed in both men and women in the United States. There are about 100,000 new cases of colon cancer and 40,000 new cases of rectal cancer each year.</p>\n\t\t<p>Like other cancers, colorectal cancer can spread (metastasize) to other parts of the body. The <a href=\"/services-and-conditions/liver-cancer\">liver</a> and <a href=\"/services-and-conditions/lung-cancer\">lungs</a> are the most common places for colorectal cancer to spread.</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"panel-group\" id=\"accordion2\" role=\"tablist\" aria-multiselectable=\"true\">\n\t\t<div class=\"panel panel-default\">\n\t\t<div class=\"panel-heading\" role=\"tab\" id=\"heading5\">\n\t\t<h3 class=\"panel-title\"><a class=\"collapsed\" role=\"button\" data-toggle=\"collapse\" data-parent=\"#accordion2\" href=\"#collapse5\" aria-expanded=\"false\" aria-controls=\"collapse5\">Know Your Risk</a></h3>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t<div id=\"collapse5\" class=\"panel-collapse collapse\" role=\"tabpanel\" aria-labelledby=\"heading5\">\n\t\t<div class=\"panel-body\">\n\t\t<p>Since colorectal cancer often doesn’t show itself until its later stages, it’s crucial to understand your risks. When you’re aware of your risk factors, your doctor can help you plan a screening schedule that makes sense to you.</p>\n\t\t<p>Colon cancer risk factors include:</p>\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t<li><strong>Age:</strong> Colorectal cancer is more likely in men and women over the age of 50.</li>\n\t\t<li><strong>Genetics:</strong> A family history of colorectal cancer or adenomatous polyps (non-cancerous growths) raises your risk of colorectal cancer. Your risk also goes up if you have inherited syndromes such as Lynch syndrome (hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer, or HNPCC).</li>\n\t\t<li><strong>Health history:</strong> Colorectal cancer is more likely if you have colorectal polyps, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease or type 2 diabetes.</li>\n\t\t<li><strong>Race and ethnicity:</strong> African Americans have the highest colorectal cancer rates of all racial groups in the U.S. Jews of Eastern European descent (Ashkenazi Jews) have one of the highest colorectal cancer risks of any ethnic group in the world.</li>\n\t\t</ul>\n\t\t<p>While there are some risk factors you can’t control, there are others you can manage by choosing to make changes. These include:</p>\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t<li><strong>Body weight:</strong> Being overweight or obese raises your risk of developing colon or rectal cancer.</li>\n\t\t<li><strong>Diet:</strong> Eating a diet high in red meats and processed meats (like hot dogs and some luncheon meats) can raise your risk of colorectal cancer. Cooking meats at very high temperatures (frying, broiling, grilling) may raise your risk of cancer overall.</li>\n\t\t<li><strong>Lifestyle:</strong> Smoking, using tobacco and consuming large amounts of alcohol can raise your risk of colorectal cancer — and many other cancers, too.</li>\n\t\t</ul>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t<div class=\"panel panel-default\">\n\t\t<div class=\"panel-heading\" role=\"tab\" id=\"heading6\">\n\t\t<h3 class=\"panel-title\"><a class=\"collapsed\" role=\"button\" data-toggle=\"collapse\" data-parent=\"#accordion2\" href=\"#collapse6\" aria-expanded=\"false\" aria-controls=\"collapse6\">Recognize the Symptoms</a></h3>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t<div id=\"collapse6\" class=\"panel-collapse collapse\" role=\"tabpanel\" aria-labelledby=\"heading6\">\n\t\t<div class=\"panel-body\">\n\t\t<p>For many, the symptoms of colon cancer can be very hard to detect, until it’s progressed to a later stage.

However, if you’re at greater risk for colorectal cancer, talk to your doctor about screening earlier and more often.</p>\n\t\t<p>A colonoscopy is the most common way to diagnose colon cancer. It involves a visual exam of your colon, using a tiny, lighted camera. If polyps are found during your screening, your doctor can remove them right away.</p>\n\t\t<p>ProMedica's <a href=\"/services-and-conditions/endoscopy/open-access-colonoscopy-program\">open access colonoscopy program</a> allows healthy people, age 50 and older and with an average risk for colon cancer, to schedule a colonoscopy without having an office visit first. Colonoscopies also offer an important advantage.</p>\n\t\t<p><a href=\"/services-and-conditions/endoscopy\">Learn more about our open access colonoscopy program.</a></p>\n\t\t<p>Other screenings are also available. These tests let you take a stool sample at home to send to the lab. Along with being more private, they are also less invasive. While they serve a purpose and can be helpful, especially between colonoscopies, these tests aren’t as accurate as colonoscopies.</p>\n\t\t<p>If a colonoscopy shows that you have colon cancer, your doctor may recommend more tests to learn the extent or stage of your cancer. Imaging exams can show the size of the tumor(s), how far into the lining of the colon and rectum the cancer has spread and if the cancer has spread to other parts of the body.</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t",

If the cancer is in a very early stage, small or medium-sized polyps can even be removed during a colonoscopy (polypectomy).</p>\n\t\t<p>Your doctor may perform an endoscopic mucosal resection during your colonoscopy, which removes the polyps as well as a layer of the colon’s lining.</p>\n\t\t<h4>Laparoscopic Colorectal Surgery</h4>\n\t\t<p>Polyps that can't be removed during a colonoscopy may be removed using laparoscopic surgery. In this minimally invasive procedure, your surgeon makes several small incisions (cuts) in your abdominal wall. The surgeon inserts a laparoscope (small, lighted video camera) through an incision to display your colon on a video monitor. Using this method, tumors can be removed without large incisions or too much soft tissue damage.</p>\n\t\t<p>In some cases, your doctor may recommend a laparoscopic partial colectomy (partial removal of the colon). The cancerous sections of the colon are removed and the healthy portions are reattached.</p>\n\t\t<h4>Colostomy</h4>\n\t\t<p>If colorectal cancer is advanced, the surgeon may not be able to reattach sections of the colon after a colectomy. A colostomy may be needed, which is a procedure that makes an opening in the abdominal wall. Waste (stool) that would normally move through the colon is rerouted to exit the body into a bag on the outside of the body. A colostomy may be temporary or permanent.</p>\n\t\t<p>At ProMedica, we know that having a colostomy has a huge impact on your daily life. That’s why we make every effort to treat your colorectal cancer conservatively or minimally invasively before recommending a colostomy.</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t",

Compiling these X-rays into images gives your radiologist essential information about your bones or your body’s soft tissues.</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"module standard-list\"><strong>Why is a CT performed?</strong> CT is requested for many reasons. Your doctor may want further information to:\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t<li>Locate an infection, a blood clot, or a tumor.</li>\n\t\t<li>Diagnose muscle or bone issues.</li>\n\t\t<li>Detect internal injuries.</li>\n\t\t<li>Diagnose and monitor heart, lung, or liver disease.</li>\n\t\t<li>Guide surgical, biopsy, or radiology procedures.</li>\n\t\t<li><a href=\"/cancer/Pages/lung-cancer/default.aspx\">Detect lung cancer</a></li>\n\t\t</ul>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t<p><strong>How does CT work?</strong> During your CT, you’ll lie down and pass slowly through a large, doughnut-shaped machine. You’ll be able to communicate with your technician the entire time, but will need to remain still during the test.

Early detection is essential to prevent fractures or the spread of disease or infection through your bones. You and your doctor can discuss the most effective treatments based on your bone scan results.</p>\n\n\t",

It’s most common in adults but can be diagnosed at any age. Though sometimes no symptoms are noticed, signs can include extreme hunger, blurry vision and frequent urination.</p>\n\t\t<p>While type 2 diabetes is a chronic condition that can’t be reversed, you can manage it with healthy lifestyle changes, medicine and insulin therapy.</p>\n\t\t<h4>Gestational diabetes</h4>\n\t\t<p>Gestational diabetes happens during pregnancy when changes in your body cause high blood sugar. It’s possible this short-term condition can be reversed. Since most women don’t notice any symptoms, your obstetrician will monitor your glucose levels often as a part of your prenatal care.</p>\n\t\t<p>You can manage gestational diabetes during your pregnancy, and it often goes away after your baby is born.</p>\n\t\t<h4>Prediabetes</h4>\n\t\t<p>As a regular part of your primary care, your doctor will test your blood sugar levels periodically (usually yearly). Since it’s possible that prediabetes can be reversed, catching it early is key.</p>\n\t\t<p>You’ll be considered prediabetic if your blood sugar levels are higher than normal, but not high enough to be diagnosed as diabetes.

It’s one of the most important ways to manage diabetes. The right diet — one rich in nutrients and good fats, but low in calories — will help you control your glucose levels.</p>\n\t\t<p>At ProMedica, our dietitians will work with you to create a diabetes medical nutrition therapy (MNT) diet. It takes into account your health as well as your likes, dislikes and lifestyle. MNT plans are designed just for you and your condition. Focused on fruits, vegetables and whole grains, your MNT plan will be built around a variety of healthy foods. It includes balanced portions and regular meals all through the day, along with wholesome snacks.</p>\n\t\t<h4>Medical Nutrition Therapy</h4>\n\t\t<p>A meal plan that’s chosen by you and your dietitian helps you maintain a healthy glucose level in your blood. When you eat too many calories and bad fats, your glucose rises in an unhealthy way. Staying on top of what you eat helps keep your glucose in check and avoids problems that come with having high blood sugar.</p>\n\t\t<p>A medical nutrition therapy plan also works well as a safe way to lose weight. Many people with diabetes find that weight loss helps them manage their glucose. Losing weight also improves your health in many other noticeable ways.</p>\n\t\t<h4>Best Foods</h4>\n\t\t<p>Your ProMedica dietitian will help you select foods that are best for you to manage diabetes. Some of the delicious, nutritious choices for you are:</p>\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t<li><strong>Fiber.</strong> Among its many health benefits, fiber helps control blood sugar levels. You’ll want to try these high-fiber foods: whole-grain pasta; garbanzo, black, and white beans; brown rice; apples; guava; strawberries; broccoli; peas; and brussels sprouts.</li>\n\t\t<li><strong>Fish.</strong> ProMedica dietitians advise eating fish twice a week. Generally, fish is lower in overall fat, saturated fat and cholesterol. Broil, bake, or poach. Avoid fried. Try tuna, salmon, mackerel and other fish high in Omega-3 fatty acid.</li>\n\t\t<li><strong>Healthy carbs.</strong> Carbohydrates are broken into three types: fiber, starches and sugars. Carbs raise your blood glucose. But eating healthy carbs in line with your meal plan helps you keep your blood sugar within a healthy range. Try whole-grain breads, sweet potatoes, quinoa, steel-cut oatmeal, kale and bananas.</li>\n\t\t<li><strong>Healthy fats.</strong> As long as you don’t eat too many of them, monounsaturated fats and polyunsaturated fats can lower cholesterol, though they tend to be higher in calories. Try avocados, walnuts, salmon, pumpkin and sesame seeds, olives and olive oil, and navy beans.</li>\n\t\t</ul>\n\t\t<h4>Foods to Avoid</h4>\n\t\t<p>When working toward your health goals you should avoid foods that contain:</p>\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t<li><strong>High sugar.</strong> Can be found in candy, desserts and sugar-sweetened beverages such as soda and sweet tea.</li>\n\t\t<li><strong>High salt.</strong> Can be found in chips, cured meats, sauces and dressings, and packaged food.</li>\n\t\t<li><strong>High cholesterol.</strong> Can be found in butter, bacon, ice cream, lobster and fried foods.</li>\n\t\t<li><strong>Trans fats.</strong> Can be found in deep-fried foods, non-dairy creamer, cake mixes and margarine.</li>\n\t\t<li><strong>Saturated fats.</strong> Can be found in cheese, butter, fatty beef, chicken with skin and whole milk.</li>\n\t\t</ul>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t",

      "articleContent": "\n\t\t<h2 class=\"alt\">Understanding Depression</h2>\n\t\t<p>Major depression is a chronic condition and different than just experiencing the occasional “blues”. If you have depression, it consistently affects your mood, thoughts and body.</p>\n\t\t<h3>Symptoms of Depression</h3>\n\t\t<p>You may notice several of the following signs during the same two-week period:</p>\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t<li>Difficulty with relationships</li>\n\t\t<li>Excessive guilt</li>\n\t\t<li>Hopelessness</li>\n\t\t<li>Extremely sensitive to failure or rejection</li>\n\t\t<li>Unable to concentrate</li>\n\t\t<li>Lack energy</li>\n\t\t<li>Lack interest in activities once enjoyed</li>\n\t\t<li>Persistent sadness</li>\n\t\t<li>Irritability, hostility, or aggression</li>\n\t\t<li>Feeling of wanting to die</li>\n\t\t<li>Changes in appetite or weight</li>\n\t\t<li>Low self-esteem</li>\n\t\t<li>Sleeping too much or very little</li>\n\t\t<li>Thinking about suicide or attempting suicide</li>\n\t\t</ul>\n\t\t<p class=\"pro-callout pro-callout--purple\">In most cases, treatment is necessary for recovery. Begin a conversation about your depression with your primary care physician, or look for a behavioral health specialist such as a counselor or psychiatrist.</p>\n\t\t<h3>Depression in Children and Adolescents</h3>\n\t\t<p>According to the National Institute of Mental Health, the onset of major depression is occurring much earlier in life than it used to. And the earlier the condition onsets, the higher the probability that it will continue into adulthood.</p>\n\t\t<p>If your adolescent has major depression, they are unable to merely “snap out of it” and feel better on their own.</p>\n\t\t<p>What should you do if your think your child has major depression? Contact your pediatrician or family doctor immediately to discuss. Early diagnosis of depression is important because it often coexists with another psychiatric disorder, such as substance abuse or anxiety disorder. If your doctor feels your child needs further assessment, they may recommend evaluation by a licensed behavioral health professional. Major depression can be effectively treated.</p>\n\t",

These conditions may include diabetic retinopathy, cataracts and glaucoma. Although eye diseases can cause severe vision loss or even blindness, they can often be treated before vision loss occurs. Prevention is the key.</p>\n\t\t<h2 id=\"faqaccordion\">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>\n\t\t<div class=\"panel-group\" role=\"tablist\" aria-multiselectable=\"true\">\n\t\t<div class=\"panel panel-default\">\n\t\t<div class=\"panel-heading\" role=\"tab\" id=\"heading1\">\n\t\t<h3 class=\"panel-title\"><a class=\"collapsed\" role=\"button\" data-toggle=\"collapse\" data-parent=\"#accordion\" href=\"#faq1\" aria-expanded=\"false\" aria-controls=\"faq1\">What is diabetic retinopathy?</a></h3>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t<div id=\"faq1\" class=\"panel-collapse collapse\" role=\"tabpanel\" aria-labelledby=\"heading1\" aria-expanded=\"false\">\n\t\t<div class=\"panel-body\">\n\t\t<p>Diabetic retinopathy is the most common eye disease in people with diabetes and is a leading cause of blindness in American adults. Changes in the blood vessels of the retina, the light sensitive layer of tissue at the back of the inner eye, can lead to this condition. In some people, retinal blood vessels may swell and leak fluid. In others, abnormal new blood vessels grow on the surface of the retina. These changes may result in vision loss or blindness.</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t<div class=\"panel panel-default\">\n\t\t<div class=\"panel-heading\" role=\"tab\" id=\"heading2\">\n\t\t<h3 class=\"panel-title\"><a class=\"collapsed\" role=\"button\" data-toggle=\"collapse\" data-parent=\"#accordion\" href=\"#faq2\" aria-expanded=\"false\" aria-controls=\"faq2\">Who is at risk for diabetic retinopathy?</a></h3>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t<div id=\"faq2\" class=\"panel-collapse collapse\" role=\"tabpanel\" aria-labelledby=\"heading2\" aria-expanded=\"false\">\n\t\t<div class=\"panel-body\">\n\t\t<p>Anyone with diabetes is at risk for diabetic retinopathy. The longer you have diabetes, the more likely you are to develop diabetic retinopathy. Your risk rises if you have diabetes and you smoke, have high blood pressure, or are pregnant.</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t<div class=\"panel panel-default\">\n\t\t<div class=\"panel-heading\" role=\"tab\" id=\"heading6\">\n\t\t<h3 class=\"panel-title\"><a class=\"collapsed\" role=\"button\" data-toggle=\"collapse\" data-parent=\"#accordion\" href=\"#faq6\" aria-expanded=\"false\" aria-controls=\"faq6\">What are the symptoms of diabetic retinopathy?</a></h3>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t<div id=\"faq6\" class=\"panel-collapse collapse\" role=\"tabpanel\" aria-labelledby=\"heading6\" aria-expanded=\"false\">\n\t\t<div class=\"panel-body\">\n\t\t<p>In the early stages of diabetic retinopathy, you may have no symptoms. Vision may not change until the disease gets worse. Then you may have blurry or double vision; dark or floating spots; pain or pressure in one or both eyes; or rings, flashing lights, or blank spots in your vision.</p>\n\t\t<p>A decrease in your central vision could be caused by macular edema which may occur from diabetic retinopathy. It happens when the macula, a part of the retina, swells from the leaking fluid and causes blurred vision. When new vessels grow on the surface of the retina, they can bleed into the eye. This may decrease vision.</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t<div class=\"panel panel-default\">\n\t\t<div class=\"panel-heading\" role=\"tab\" id=\"heading7\">\n\t\t<h3 class=\"panel-title\"><a class=\"collapsed\" role=\"button\" data-toggle=\"collapse\" data-parent=\"#accordion\" href=\"#faq7\" aria-expanded=\"false\" aria-controls=\"faq7\">How is diabetic retinopathy diagnosed?</a></h3>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t<div id=\"faq7\" class=\"panel-collapse collapse\" role=\"tabpanel\" aria-labelledby=\"heading7\" aria-expanded=\"false\">\n\t\t<div class=\"panel-body\">\n\t\t<p>Along with a complete health history and eye exam, your eye care professional may do these tests to diagnose diabetic retinopathy:</p>\n\t\t<ul class=\"standard-list module\">\n\t\t<li>Visual acuity test. This is the common eye chart test that measures vision ability at various distances.</li>\n\t\t<li>Tonometry. This standard test is done to check the pressure (intraocular pressure, or IOP) inside the eye.</li>\n\t\t<li>Pupil dilation. For a close up exam of the eye’s lens and retina, your pupil is widened with eye drops.</li>\n\t\t<li>Ophthalmoscopy. This is a test where a doctor looks very closely at the retina using a special magnifying glass.</li>\n\t\t<li>Fluorescein angiography. In this test, a dye is injected into the bloodstream. The dye helps the blood vessels in the eye show up while pictures are taken with a special camera. This test lets the doctor see if the blood vessels are leaking.</li>\n\t\t<li>Optical coherence tomography. In this test, light waves are used to make detailed images of the retina.</li>\n\t\t</ul>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t<div class=\"panel panel-default\">\n\t\t<div class=\"panel-heading\" role=\"tab\" id=\"heading8\">\n\t\t<h3 class=\"panel-title\"><a class=\"collapsed\" role=\"button\" data-toggle=\"collapse\" data-parent=\"#accordion\" href=\"#faq8\" aria-expanded=\"false\" aria-controls=\"faq8\">How is diabetic retinopathy treated?</a></h3>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t<div id=\"faq8\" class=\"panel-collapse collapse\" role=\"tabpanel\" aria-labelledby=\"heading8\" aria-expanded=\"false\">\n\t\t<div class=\"panel-body\">\n\t\t<p>If you have diabetic retinopathy, your treatment will depend on your age, general health, symptoms and the severity of the condition.</p>\n\t\t<p>Even people with advanced retinopathy have a good chance of keeping their vision if they are treated before the retina becomes severely damaged. Treatment for diabetic retinopathy may include:</p>\n\t\t<ul class=\"standard-list module\">\n\t\t<li>Laser surgery. This involves shrinking the abnormal blood vessels, or sealing the leaking ones.</li>\n\t\t<li>Vitrectomy. Vitrectomy is a procedure that involves removing the cloudy, jelly-like substance (vitreous) that fills the center of the eye. The vitreous is replaced with a saline solution.</li>\n\t\t<li>Injections. Certain medications can be injected into the eye to slow the growth of the abnormal vessels of the retina.</li>\n\t\t</ul>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t<div class=\"panel panel-default\">\n\t\t<div class=\"panel-heading\" role=\"tab\" id=\"heading9\">\n\t\t<h3 class=\"panel-title\"><a class=\"collapsed\" role=\"button\" data-toggle=\"collapse\" data-parent=\"#accordion\" href=\"#faq9\" aria-expanded=\"false\" aria-controls=\"faq9\">Can diabetic retinopathy be prevented? </a></h3>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t<div id=\"faq9\" class=\"panel-collapse collapse\" role=\"tabpanel\" aria-labelledby=\"heading9\" aria-expanded=\"false\">\n\t\t<div class=\"panel-body\">\n\t\t<p>While you can’t completely prevent diabetic retinopathy, you can reduce your risk of getting it. Controlling your blood sugar slows the start of retinopathy and keeps it from getting worse. It also lessens the need for laser surgery for severe retinopathy.</p>\n\t\t<p><strong>You can reduce the risk of developing the condition by:</strong></p>\n\t\t<ul class=\"standard-list module\">\n\t\t<li>Having a dilated eye exam once a year. An eye exam does not prevent retinopathy but it can help diagnose eye problems that can then be treated. An eye exam can also alert you and your healthcare provider if the diabetes needs to be better controlled.</li>\n\t\t<li>Having an eye exam before pregnancy or in the first trimester of your pregnancy. If you’re pregnant and take insulin to manage your diabetes, that can raise the odds that the condition will become worse. Continue to be monitored every trimester and for 1 year after birth depending on how severe the retinopathy is.</li>\n\t\t</ul>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t",

It coordinates the contractions that pump blood through your heart and out to the rest of your body.</p>\n\t\t<p>Based on your age and overall health, your heart contracts and dilates 60 to 100 times a minute. But when your heart has trouble starting a heartbeat or naturally pacing your heart rhythm, your body may not get enough blood.</p>\n\t\t<p>Pacemakers and implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICD) are the two types of heart devices that treat irregular heartbeats. A surgeon implants one of these devices to send electrical pulses to your heart. This should reset your heart to its normal rhythm.</p>\n\t\t<p>ProMedica’s experienced team of cardiac electrophysiologists will help you decide if a pacemaker or an ICD is the best way to treat your abnormal heart rhythm.

There are two types of pacemakers — biventricular and leadless pacemakers.</p>\n\t\t<p>Biventricular pacemakers are used for ventricles (heart chambers) that don’t contract at the same time. They work to pace both ventricles to contract in unison.</p>\n\t\t<p>Leadless pacemakers are a newer type of pacemaker technology that removes the need for a surgical pocket and insulated wires (known as “leads”) to pace the heart. Instead, the leadless pacemaker is a self-contained generator and electrode system that’s implanted directly into the right ventricle. Since it is only placed in one ventricle, it is also called a ventricular pacemaker.</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t<div class=\"panel panel-default\">\n\t\t<div class=\"panel-heading\" role=\"tab\" id=\"heading2\">\n\t\t<h3 class=\"panel-title\"><a class=\"collapsed\" role=\"button\" data-toggle=\"collapse\" data-parent=\"#accordion\" href=\"#collapse2\" aria-expanded=\"false\" aria-controls=\"collapse2\">Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillator (ICD)</a></h3>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t<div id=\"collapse2\" class=\"panel-collapse collapse\" role=\"tabpanel\" aria-labelledby=\"heading2\" aria-expanded=\"false\">\n\t\t<div class=\"panel-body\">\n\t\t<p>An implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) is similar to a pacemaker. Some ICDs even have pacemakers built into them. An ICD device can send the same type of low-energy pulses to your heart that pacemakers do, but it can also detect more life-threatening arrhythmias. Then it will send a high-energy pulse if an arrhythmia becomes dangerous or your heart stops beating. For this reason, ICDs are advised for patients who are at high risk for a life-threatening ventricular arrhythmia.</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t<div class=\"panel panel-default\">\n\t\t<div class=\"panel-heading\" role=\"tab\" id=\"heading3\">\n\t\t<h3 class=\"panel-title\"><a class=\"collapsed\" role=\"button\" data-toggle=\"collapse\" data-parent=\"#accordion\" href=\"#collapse3\" aria-expanded=\"false\" aria-controls=\"collapse3\">Subcutaneous Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillator (S-ICD)</a></h3>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t<div id=\"collapse3\" class=\"panel-collapse collapse\" role=\"tabpanel\" aria-labelledby=\"heading3\" aria-expanded=\"false\">\n\t\t<div class=\"panel-body\">\n\t\t<p>A subcutaneous implantable cardioverter defibrillator (S-ICD) has all of the benefits of an ICD with less risk because it’s not attached to the heart.

This should be done at least one time between ages 20 and 29 and at least two times between ages 30 and 39.</li>\n\t\t<li>If you’re an adult with no symptoms or eye disease risk factors, the American Academy of Ophthalmology now recommends a baseline complete eye exam at age 40 to screen for eye diseases. Between the ages of 40 and 60, adults should follow up at the times that are recommended by their eye doctor. This will depend on factors that are evaluated at the baseline exam.</li>\n\t\t<li>Older adults ages 60 and over should have a complete eye exam every one or two years. The exam should check for eye diseases such as diabetic retinopathy, glaucoma, age-related macular degeneration and cataracts.

Having an astigmatism means your cornea is shaped like a football, which causes objects both near and far to be distorted and out of focus.</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t<div class=\"panel panel-default\">\n\t\t<div class=\"panel-heading\" role=\"tab\" id=\"heading15\">\n\t\t<h3 class=\"panel-title\"><a class=\"collapsed\" role=\"button\" data-toggle=\"collapse\" data-parent=\"#accordion3\" href=\"#collapse15\" aria-expanded=\"false\" aria-controls=\"collapse15\">Sometimes I see spots or things that seem to float.

As we get older, the vitreous (the clear, gel-like substance that fills the inside of the eye) tends to shrink slightly, detach from the retina and form clumps within the eye. What you see are the shadows these clumps cast on the retina, the light-sensitive nerve layer that lines the back of the eye.</p>\n\t\t<p>Floaters can get in the way of clear vision, often when reading. Try looking up and then down to move the floaters out of the way. While some floaters may remain, many of them will fade over time.</p>\n\t\t<p>If you have a sudden “flash” of light or rush of floaters, you may have a tear in your retina, or your retina may be detaching from the back of the eye. This is a serious problem that must be treated by a healthcare provider as soon as possible to avoid losing vision permanently.</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t<div class=\"panel panel-default\">\n\t\t<div class=\"panel-heading\" role=\"tab\" id=\"heading16\">\n\t\t<h3 class=\"panel-title\"><a class=\"collapsed\" role=\"button\" data-toggle=\"collapse\" data-parent=\"#accordion3\" href=\"#collapse16\" aria-expanded=\"false\" aria-controls=\"collapse16\">Is glaucoma curable?</a></h3>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t<div id=\"collapse16\" class=\"panel-collapse collapse\" role=\"tabpanel\" aria-labelledby=\"heading16\">\n\t\t<div class=\"panel-body\">\n\t\t<p>Currently, there is no cure for glaucoma.

These checkups are important for any girl or woman who is sexually active. If not, these exams should start at age 13 to 15.</p>\n\t\t<p>During this visit, your gynecologist will listen carefully to any symptoms or problem you may have. You may also have some of the following tests and procedures:</p>\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t<li><strong>Breast exam</strong>: Your gynecologist is an expert at checking for any lumps or other abnormalities in your breasts, and will do it quickly and efficiently.</li>\n\t\t<li><strong>General health check</strong>: Your personal and family health history can offer clues to your health today. That’s why we’ll ask about any conditions you or someone in your family have had. Your nurse will also weigh you, take your blood pressure and may also ask you to take blood and urine tests.</li>\n\t\t<li><strong>Internal bimanual exam</strong>: This test is done to check for problems in your cervix, uterus, fallopian tubes and ovaries. To complete the bimanual exam, your provider inserts two gloved, lubricated fingers into your vagina while lightly pressing on your abdomen with the other hand. This is done to feel around for any growths or abnormalities.</li>\n\t\t<li><strong>Pap test</strong>: This test is done during your pelvic exam to check for cervical cancer and other problems. Your gynecologist uses a small brush to collect cell samples from your cervix, which are sent to a lab for testing.</li>\n\t\t<li><strong>Pelvic exam:</strong> It’s normal to feel uneasy about this exam, but it’s important to your health. Your gynecologist will examine your vagina and cervix. You may feel some pressure during this exam, but it shouldn’t be painful.</li>\n\t\t<li><strong>STD tests</strong>: If you’re sexually active, you may have a sexually transmitted disease (STD) even if you don’t have symptoms. Your gynecologist may take a swab of cells during your pelvic exam, or order blood or urine tests, to check for STDs such as gonorrhea, chlamydia, syphilis or HIV.</li>\n\t\t</ul>\n\t\t<p>Your gynecologist will also help you know how to listen to your body, so you can tell what’s normal and recognize when there may be a problem. For example, many women have <a href=\"/services-and-conditions/pelvic-health\">chronic pelvic pain</a> yet they suffer in silence. If this includes you, please make an appointment. We’re here to help.</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t<div class=\"panel panel-default\">\n\t\t<div class=\"panel-heading\" role=\"tab\" id=\"heading2\">\n\t\t<h3 class=\"panel-title\"><a class=\"collapsed\" role=\"button\" data-toggle=\"collapse\" data-parent=\"#accordion\" href=\"#collapse2\" aria-expanded=\"false\" aria-controls=\"collapse2\">Birth Control Guidance</a></h3>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t<div id=\"collapse2\" class=\"panel-collapse collapse\" role=\"tabpanel\" aria-labelledby=\"heading2\">\n\t\t<div class=\"panel-body\">\n\t\t<p>When you choose a method of birth control, you’ll be considering many issues — most of them personal. Your ProMedica gynecologist can give you the information you need to choose which of these options is best for you:</p>\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t<li><strong> Barrier methods: </strong> This includes condoms, diaphragms, cervical caps and contraceptive sponges. All of these block the sperm from fertilizing the egg.</li>\n\t\t<li><strong> Birth Control Pills: </strong> With about 12 million women in the United States using birth control pills, they’re by far the most common method of birth control and are proven to prevent pregnancy when you take them correctly.</li>\n\t\t<li><strong> Hormonal methods: </strong> Birth control pills, a contraceptive implant (Implanon), a contraceptive injection (Depo-Provera), the vaginal ring (NuvaRing) and the contraceptive patch (Ortho Evra) are all examples of hormonal birth control. They keep you from ovulating, so there is no egg for sperm cells to fertilize.</li>\n\t\t<li><strong> Intrauterine devices (IUDs): </strong> These include the copper IUD (ParaGard) and hormonal IUD (Mirena). Both work by changing the way sperm cells move so they can’t fertilize the egg.</li>\n\t\t<li><strong> Sterilization: </strong> Tubal ligation, or having your tubes tied, keeps your eggs away from sperm cells. Essure® is a permanent, non-surgical way to keep eggs away from sperm.</li>\n\t\t<li><strong> Natural family planning, or the rhythm method: </strong> With this type of birth control, you avoid intercourse based on your basal body temperature and your cervical mucus, which can tell you when you will ovulate.</li>\n\t\t</ul>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t<div class=\"panel panel-default\">\n\t\t<div class=\"panel-heading\" role=\"tab\" id=\"heading3\">\n\t\t<h3 class=\"panel-title\"><a class=\"collapsed\" role=\"button\" data-toggle=\"collapse\" data-parent=\"#accordion\" href=\"#collapse3\" aria-expanded=\"false\" aria-controls=\"collapse3\">Gynecology Care for Adolescents</a></h3>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t<div id=\"collapse3\" class=\"panel-collapse collapse\" role=\"tabpanel\" aria-labelledby=\"heading3\">\n\t\t<div class=\"panel-body\">\n\t\t<p>If you have a young daughter, you’ve probably thought about “the talk.” This can mean talking to her about the body changes she’ll experience with puberty, along with everything that follows as she gets older.</p>\n\t\t<p>We can help with this. Your gynecologist can give you ideas about how to talk with your daughter about sex, sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), and the health care she will need as she grows up.</p>\n\t\t<h4>Your Daughter's First Gynecologic Exam</h4>\n\t\t<p>This is an important doctor visit, since it can set the tone for your daughter’s future healthcare experiences. The gynecologists at ProMedica understand how to talk with girls and how to put them at ease.</p>\n\t\t<p>Schedule your daughter’s first gynecologic exam when she’s 13 to 15 years old or when she becomes sexually active, whichever comes first.

Gardasil and Cervarix are FDA-approved vaccines that prevent most cervical cancers if they are given before your daughter is exposed to the HPV virus.</p>\n\t\t<p>Both should be given between the ages of 11 and 12 years, in a series of three injections over a six month period. They can prevent vaginal and vulvar cancer, and Gardasil can also prevent genital warts and anal cancer.</p>\n\t\t</li>\n\t\t<li>\n\t\t<p><strong> HPV vaccine: </strong> The human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine protects against four major types of HPV. This can help your daughter avoid most genital warts and most cervical cancers.</p>\n\t\t<p>This vaccine is given in three doses, with the first recommended between the ages of 11 and 12 years. The second dose is given one or two months after that, and the third dose is given six months after the first injection.</p>\n\t\t</li>\n\t\t</ul>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t<div class=\"panel panel-default\">\n\t\t<div class=\"panel-heading\" role=\"tab\" id=\"heading5\">\n\t\t<h3 class=\"panel-title\"><a class=\"collapsed\" role=\"button\" data-toggle=\"collapse\" data-parent=\"#accordion\" href=\"#collapse5\" aria-expanded=\"false\" aria-controls=\"collapse5\">Menopause Counseling</a></h3>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t<div id=\"collapse5\" class=\"panel-collapse collapse\" role=\"tabpanel\" aria-labelledby=\"heading5\">\n\t\t<div class=\"panel-body\">\n\t\t<p>Your sexual health and needs may change around your menopause years.

They help decide what we look like and how our body is built.</p>\n\t\t<p>Sometimes our genes change, or they look different from normal genes. This is called a mutation. Mutations can affect how cells in your body behave. In some cases, a mutation can raise your risk for cancer.</p>\n\t\t<p>Scientists have found certain gene mutations can raise the risk for certain cancers. For example, mutated BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes can raise the risk for ovarian and breast cancers.</p>\n\t\t<p>When parents pass one of these gene mutations to their children, it’s called a hereditary cancer syndrome. Families with this syndrome are more likely to have cancer.</p>\n\t\t<p>Genetic counseling and testing can help show if you or family members have a hereditary cancer syndrome. If you have the syndrome, you can work with your doctor to come up with a prevention plan. This plan can include regular cancer screenings, lifestyle changes and preventive surgery.</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"panel-group\" id=\"accordion\" role=\"tablist\" aria-multiselectable=\"true\">\n\t\t<div class=\"panel panel-default\">\n\t\t<div class=\"panel-heading\" role=\"tab\" id=\"heading1\">\n\t\t<h3 class=\"panel-title\"><a role=\"button\" data-toggle=\"collapse\" data-parent=\"#accordion\" href=\"#collapse1\" aria-expanded=\"false\" aria-controls=\"collapse1\">Know When to Test</a></h3>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t<div id=\"collapse1\" class=\"panel-collapse collapse in\" role=\"tabpanel\" aria-labelledby=\"heading1\">\n\t\t<div class=\"panel-body\">\n\t\t<p>Some cancers are linked to certain genetic mutations.

Our program is run by board-certified, licensed genetic counselors, and is the largest in the region.</p>\n\t\t<p>During this appointment, you’ll talk about your personal and family health history so it’s helpful to prepare this ahead of time. The licensed genetic counselor will discuss options for you and your family. These may include further genetic testing, possible changes to medical screening procedures and frequencies, and other risk reducing options.</p>\n\t\t<p>If genetic testing is deemed appropriate, we’ll refer you to one of the ProMedica hospitals that has genetic testing services. We have nine genetic testing locations in northwest Ohio and southeast Michigan. Once your test results are ready, we’ll go over the results together and come up with a plan for screening and prevention. The genetic counselor will send this plan to your doctor.</p>\n\t\t<p>Prevention plans are different for everyone. They may include starting cancer screenings early, such as mammograms or colonoscopies. Some people also consider preventive surgery. Your genetic counselor will go over all your choices and will answer any questions you have along the way.</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t",

When your arteries are clear, blood flows easily through your body. However, when something interrupts the flow of blood to your heart, it causes heart tissue to die (a heart attack). It can also affect how well your heart pumps in the future.</p>\n\t\t<p>The most common cause of heart attack is coronary artery disease (CAD). With this condition, fatty deposits called plaque build up inside the arteries that supply oxygen-rich blood to your heart muscle.</p>\n\t\t<p>If plaque restricts your blood flow, or part of it breaks off and forms a clot that blocks blood flow, your heart won’t get the oxygen it needs. This can result in chest pain called angina or in a heart attack.</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t<div class=\"panel panel-default\">\n\t\t<div class=\"panel-heading\" role=\"tab\" id=\"heading2\">\n\t\t<h3 class=\"panel-title\"><a class=\"collapsed\" role=\"button\" data-toggle=\"collapse\" data-parent=\"#accordion\" href=\"#collapse2\" aria-expanded=\"false\" aria-controls=\"collapse2\">What are the symptoms of heart attack?</a></h3>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t<div id=\"collapse2\" class=\"panel-collapse collapse\" role=\"tabpanel\" aria-labelledby=\"heading2\">\n\t\t<div class=\"panel-body\">\n\t\t<p>Identifying heart attack symptoms can be tricky. The sudden, overwhelming symptoms portrayed in movies don’t always happen: They vary from person to person, and between men and women. Being aware of these signs can mean getting help for you or your loved one when every second counts, and can be life-saving:</p>\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t<li>Chest discomfort that can feel like pressure, squeezing, fullness or pain. This can last for several minutes, or go away and come back.</li>\n\t\t<li>Cold sweat, nausea, vomiting or lightheadedness.</li>\n\t\t<li>Shortness of breath, which can happen before or during your chest discomfort.</li>\n\t\t<li>Upper body discomfort in one or both arms or in your back, neck, jaw or stomach.</li>\n\t\t<li>For women, heart attack symptoms often don’t include crushing chest pain or discomfort. Rather, women tend to have discomfort in one or both arms, their back, neck, jaw or stomach.</li>\n\t\t</ul>\n\t\t<div class=\"alert alert-info\">Only 27% of people are aware of the major signs of a heart attack.</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t<div class=\"panel panel-default\">\n\t\t<div class=\"panel-heading\" role=\"tab\" id=\"heading3\">\n\t\t<h3 class=\"panel-title\"><a class=\"collapsed\" role=\"button\" data-toggle=\"collapse\" data-parent=\"#accordion\" href=\"#collapse3\" aria-expanded=\"false\" aria-controls=\"collapse3\">How do I lower my risk for a heart attack?</a></h3>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t<div id=\"collapse3\" class=\"panel-collapse collapse\" role=\"tabpanel\" aria-labelledby=\"heading3\">\n\t\t<div class=\"panel-body\">\n\t\t<p>Take these healthy steps to strengthen your heart and lower your heart attack risk:</p>\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t<li><strong>Be active:</strong> Any physical activity will benefit your heart. Exercise increases blood circulation, improves your energy and helps you manage stress. It also helps control your weight.</li>\n\t\t<li><strong>Control your blood pressure:</strong> A normal blood pressure lessens the strain on your heart and minimizes your risk.</li>\n\t\t<li><strong>Eat healthy foods:</strong> Load up on fruits, vegetables, whole grains, nuts, lean meats, fish and healthy oils — and bake, broil, poach or grill your foods. Limit red meat, salt, and packaged foods.</li>\n\t\t<li><strong>Know your family history:</strong> If you have a family history of CAD or heart attack, you may be at increased risk yourself. Discuss any family history of these conditions with your doctor.</li>\n\t\t<li><strong>Limit your alcohol intake:</strong> Consuming alcohol can raise your blood pressure, increase your weight and sometimes cause heart conditions such as irregular heart beat, cardiomyopathy and stroke.</li>\n\t\t<li><strong>Maintain a healthy weight:</strong> Excess weight is linked to the hardening of your arteries, which increases your risk for heart attack. Maintaining a healthy diet and weight can decrease your risk.</li>\n\t\t<li><strong>Reduce stress:</strong> Ongoing or severe bouts of stress can increase your heart rate, blood pressure and your body’s demand for oxygen — all of which can affect your heart.</li>\n\t\t<li><strong>Stop smoking:</strong> You’ll breathe easier. Your food will taste better. You’ll feel better mentally and physically — and you’ll reduce your heart attack risk significantly. Learn more about <a href=\"/services-and-conditions/tobacco-cessation\">ProMedica’s Stop Smoking Programs.</a></li>\n\t\t<li><strong>Take your heart medication:</strong> Staying on schedule with any prescribed heart medications is important. Make sure you’re taking the right dose, at the right times. It’s also a good idea to carry an up-to-date list of all your medications with you, including your prescribed medicines as well as over-the-counter ones you take often.</li>\n\t\t<li><strong>Schedule routine check-ups: </strong> Seeing your primary care provider at least once a year will help you maintain an overall healthy lifestyle and will help identify any potential heart issues.</li>\n\t\t</ul>\n\t\t<p>Our compassionate team is ready to support your journey to whole health, whether you are working to prevent a heart condition, lower your risk for heart attack, manage an existing heart condition or heal from a cardiac event.

The ambulance will have emergency medical personnel who can provide life-saving treatment at the scene. They can also inform doctors in the emergency department about important details before arrival at the hospital, so they’ll be prepared with the best treatments.</p>\n\t\t<p>While you wait for an ambulance, you can have the symptomatic person chew a regular-strength (325mg) aspirin if you have any available. Aspirin is an anticoagulant and can help prevent blood clots.</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"alert alert-danger\">Call 911 at the first sign of any heart attack symptoms. Don't hesitate.

It’s important to understand that a single risk factor makes it more likely you’ll develop heart-related problems. The more of these risk factors you have, the more concerned you need to be about seeking prevention and treatment.</p>\n\t\t<h4>High Blood Pressure</h4>\n\t\t<p>High blood pressure places extra stress on the walls of your arteries. That’s why you’ll want to keep your blood pressure within a normal range.</p>\n\t\t<h4>High Cholesterol</h4>\n\t\t<p>High cholesterol raises your risk of heart disease. That means it’s important to check your cholesterol levels regularly.</p>\n\t\t<h4>Lack of Physical Activity</h4>\n\t\t<p>Exercising makes your heart able to do a better job of pumping blood. It also raises your heart rate, which helps build a healthier heart. Aim for 150 minutes of moderate physical activity each week.</p>\n\t\t<h4>Obesity</h4>\n\t\t<p>Excess weight makes your heart work harder and raises your risk for high blood pressure, high cholesterol and diabetes.</p>\n\t\t<h4>Smoking</h4>\n\t\t<p>Nicotine has been shown to narrow arteries and destroy the cells that line your arteries.

With atrial fibrillation surgery (sometimes called the maze procedure), scar tissue is created through a number of small incisions. This scar tissue stops the abnormal signals that caused the atrial fibrillation. This allows your heart rhythm to return to normal.</p>\n\t\t<a class=\"btn btn-primary\" href=\"/services-and-conditions/atrial-fibrillation-afib\">Learn more about AFib </a>\n\t\t<h3>Coronary Artery Bypass Surgery</h3>\n\t\t<p>Coronary artery bypass graft surgery, or CABG, is a procedure used to treat coronary artery disease. If your arteries become blocked because plaque builds up, you may need bypass surgery. This helps restore oxygen and blood flow from your heart to the rest of your body.</p>\n\t\t<h3>Thoracic Aortic Aneurysm Repair</h3>\n\t\t<p>A thoracic aortic aneurysm repair is done when the portion of your aorta that runs through your chest needs to be replaced. If you develop a weak spot or the aorta begins to bulge, you may need surgery to repair or remove the aneurysm.</p>\n\t\t<a class=\"btn btn-primary\" href=\"/services-and-conditions/aortic-surgery\">Learn more about aortic surgery</a>\n\t\t<h3>Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement (TAVR)</h3>\n\t\t<p>With TAVR, the aortic valve is replaced using a catheter, which is inserted through a small incision (cut). The artificial valve is expanded inside the existing valve by inflating a balloon.</p>\n\t\t<a class=\"btn btn-primary\" href=\"/services-and-conditions/structural-heart-disease#overview\">Learn more about TAVR </a>\n\t\t<h3>Valve Surgery</h3>\n\t\t<p>Four valves direct blood flow through your heart. Heart valve repair or replacement surgery is needed when your valves are damaged or diseased and don’t work as they should. Your valves can become blocked (a condition called stenosis) or they may leak. This may cause shortness of breath, fatigue and chest pain. Valve surgery can repair or replace mitral, aortic and tricuspid valves, and can be both open and minimally invasive.</p>\n\t\t<a class=\"btn btn-primary\" href=\"/services-and-conditions/valve-surgery\">Learn more about valve surgery </a></div>\n\t\t",

This means you may have excessive bleeding after an injury, surgery or dental work, or you may even bleed for no known reason.</p>\n\t\t<h4>Moderate Hemophilia</h4>\n\t\t<p>If you have moderate hemophilia, 1-5% of your blood has clotting factor. While most people with moderate hemophilia have excessive bleeding after trauma, surgery or dental work too, they do not have as many episodes of unexplained bleeding.</p>\n\t\t<h4>Mild Hemophilia</h4>\n\t\t<p>If you have mild hemophilia, it means 5-50% of your blood is made up of clotting factor.

At ProMedica, we help people who:</p>\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t<li>Are interested in an advanced, minimally invasive robotic hernia repair.</li>\n\t\t<li>Are newly diagnosed with a hernia.</li>\n\t\t<li>Have been living with a hernia and have decided it’s time for surgery.</li>\n\t\t<li>Need a complex abdominal wall reconstruction.</li>\n\t\t</ul>\n\t\t<p>Our Hernia Program team streamlines the process of hernia repair. We offer safe, comfortable procedures including robotic surgery, which means you can benefit from a shorter recovery time.</p>\n\t\t<p>Your ProMedica hernia surgeon will choose the best type of surgery for your specific hernia. We provide these types of hernia surgery in Toledo and the surrounding area:</p>\n\t\t<h3>Open Hernia Repair</h3>\n\t\t<p>With this procedure, your surgeon cuts the skin at your groin and pushes the bulging intestine back into your belly. The opening in the muscle wall is then stitched closed. If your muscle wall is weak, your surgeon may use a steel mesh or wire to strengthen the area.</p>\n\t\t<h3>Laparoscopic Hernia Repair</h3>\n\t\t<p>Your surgeon will make several small incisions in your lower belly, then insert a thin, flexible tube into one of the incisions. The tube, which is called a catheter, has a camera that allows your surgeon to see the area. Other catheters have tiny instruments that your surgeon uses to repair the hernia and use steel mesh, if necessary.</p>\n\t\t<h3>Robotic Hernia Repair</h3>\n\t\t<p>This type of surgery is also performed with small incisions. The surgeon sits at a console a few feet from the operating table and uses a camera and tiny instruments to repair your hernia. Our Hernia Program is centered on minimally invasive robotic hernia repair, which can shorten your recovery time.</p>\n\t\t",

But foods that come from animal sources, such as meats, dairy products and oils that contain saturated fat, also raise cholesterol levels.</p>\n\t\t<p>Other things that can contribute to unhealthy cholesterol levels include:</p>\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t<li>Age.</li>\n\t\t<li>Excess weight.</li>\n\t\t<li>Family history.</li>\n\t\t<li>Lack of exercise.</li>\n\t\t<li>Tobacco smoke.</li>\n\t\t</ul>\n\t\t<p>Cholesterol moves through your bloodstream on proteins known as lipoproteins. There are several types:</p>\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t<li><strong>High-density lipoprotein (HDL):</strong> Often called “good cholesterol,” HDL helps your body get rid of excess cholesterol, lowering your risk for heart disease.</li>\n\t\t<li><strong>Low-density lipoprotein (LDL):</strong> LDL is the bad cholesterol that causes the most buildup in your arteries. The higher your LDL levels, the greater your risk for cardiovascular disease.</li>\n\t\t<li><strong>Very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL):</strong> VLDL is like LDL, carrying a fat called triglycerides. Alcohol and sugar are two major contributors to high triglyceride levels.</li>\n\t\t</ul>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t",
      "prevention": "<a name=\"prevention\"></a>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t<h2>Prevention and Treatment</h2>\n\t\t<h3>Getting Your Cholesterol Checked</h3>\n\t\t<p>Since you can have abnormal cholesterol levels without having symptoms, regular cholesterol checks are extremely important. A simple blood test after you fast can provide the information your doctor needs to determine if treatment is needed to ensure your heart health.</p>\n\t\t<p>The American Heart Association recommends adults 20 years and older have their cholesterol checked every four to six years if they’re at low risk. Children should be screened once between the age of 9 and 11 and then again between the ages of 17 and 21.</p>\n\t\t<p>In general, optimal cholesterol levels for a healthy adult are:</p>\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t<li>60 mg/dL or higher for HDL.</li>\n\t\t<li>100 mg/dL or lower for LDL.</li>\n\t\t<li>200 mg/dL or lower for total cholesterol.</li>\n\t\t</ul>\n\t\t</ul>\n\t\t<p>Your doctor will consider many factors, such as your lifestyle and other health conditions — along with your various cholesterol levels — to weigh your risk for cardiovascular disease and decide if you need treatment.</p>\n\t\t<h3>Changing Your Lifestyle</h3>\n\t\t<p>While you can’t control factors like your age or family history, there are many lifestyle changes you can make to lower your risk for getting high cholesterol or manage the condition:</p>\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t<li>Drink alcohol in moderation, if you drink at all.</li>\n\t\t<li>Eat a healthy diet. Include fruits, vegetables, whole grains, fish, skinless and lean poultry, nonfat dairy products, beans and nuts. Limit saturated fats, trans fats and salt.</li>\n\t\t<li>Exercise regularly.</li>\n\t\t<li>Quit smoking.</li>\n\t\t</ul>\n\t\t</ul>\n\t\t</ul>\n\t\t<p>In some cases, your doctor may also recommend medication to help you reach healthier cholesterol levels. Talk with your doctor if you have concerns about your cholesterol or to learn more ways to lower your risk of heart disease.</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t",

      "articleContent": "\t\t<h2>About the Infant Monitor Program</h2>\n\t\t<p>Assuring the safe transportation of infants is a requirement at the time of hospital discharge, and consequently, medically fragile and/or premature infants generally undergo a car seat challenge to ensure they are physiologically ready to travel in a rear-facing car seat. Most tested (or challenged) infants will travel home from the hospital in a properly fitted car seat; however, because some infants are unable to maintain a patent airway in the semi-reclined position of a car seat, they must instead travel home in a recumbent car bed.&nbsp;</p>\n\t\t<p>We meet the needs of high-risk infants at <a href=\"/location/promedica-russell-j-ebeid-childrens-hospital\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"ProMedica Russell J. Ebeid Children's Hospital\">ProMedica Russell J. Ebeid Children's Hospital</a> with our diagnostic, therapeutic&nbsp;and educational Infant Monitor Program. We support infants and families whose conditions require the use of home monitoring services. Our pediatric pulmonologists are lung specialists who are board-certified in pediatrics and in pediatric pulmonary medicine with a specialty in intensive care and direct patient care. Our team of physicians, nurses&nbsp;and respiratory therapists follow your baby’s care.</p>\n\t\t<p>Infants referred to the Infant Monitor Program may be:</p>\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t<li>Babies who experience an apparent life-threatening event (ALTE)</li>\n\t\t<li>SIDS siblings</li>\n\t\t<li>Premature infants with apnea / bradycardia</li>\n\t\t<li>Infants with obstructive apnea</li>\n\t\t<li>Babies with seizure / neurological-related apnea</li>\n\t\t<li>Oxygen dependent infants</li>\n\t\t<li>Infants with cardiac problems</li>\n\t\t</ul>\n\t\t<p>Infants that initially fail the car seat challenge should undergo an additional car seat challenge prior to transitioning to a traditional, semi-reclined car seat. The Infant Monitor Program staff at <a href=\"/location/promedica-toledo-hospital\" title=\"ProMedica Toledo Hospital\">Toledo </a>and Russell J. Ebeid Children's Hospital's&nbsp;will administer follow-up test on infants that failed their initial Car Seat Challenge Testing prior to discharge.&nbsp;</p>\n\t\t<p>Follow-up out-patient testing is done in Harris McIntosh Tower&nbsp;by a Respiratory Therapist or an RN, when the pediatrician feels it is time to re-test.&nbsp; A test will take a minimum&nbsp;of 90 minutes.&nbsp;</p>\n\t\t<p>We can be reached by telephone 24 hours a day to answer questions and solve problems related to infant alarms and/or equipment use</p>\n\t\t<p class=\"pro-callout pro-callout--purple\">Contact the Infant Monitor Program at <a rel=\"tel\" href=\"tel:+14192912229\">419-291-2229</a> or <a rel=\"tel\" href=\"tel:+18008762763\">800-876-2763</a>.</p>\n\n\t",

These cells, as they keep growing and spreading, keep your lungs from working normally. This growth can also spread beyond your lungs, too, by a process called metastasis.</p>\n\t\t<p>There are five different types of lung cancer. The two most common are non-small cell carcinoma and small cell carcinoma, which make up 96% of all lung cancers.</p>\n\t\t<p>When you know your risk, you can take steps to help prevent the disease and stay on top of any recommended screenings. Early diagnosis is more treatable and could save your life, because treatment may begin before the cancer spreads. According to the American Cancer Society, the 5-year relative survival rate is 61% for non-small cell lung cancer patients and 27% for small cell lung cancer patients if the cancer is detected while it is still in the lungs and hasn’t metastasized beyond the lungs.</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"panel-group\" id=\"accordionTwo\" role=\"tablist\" aria-multiselectable=\"true\">\n\t\t<div class=\"panel panel-default\">\n\t\t<div class=\"panel-heading\" role=\"tab\" id=\"heading11\">\n\t\t<h3 class=\"panel-title\"><a role=\"button\" data-toggle=\"collapse\" data-parent=\"#accordionTwo\" href=\"#collapse11\" aria-expanded=\"false\" aria-controls=\"collapse11\">Know Your Risk</a></h3>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t<div id=\"collapse11\" class=\"panel-collapse collapse in\" role=\"tabpanel\" aria-labelledby=\"heading11\">\n\t\t<div class=\"panel-body\">\n\t\t<p>Smoking is the single greatest risk factor for lung cancer. Smoking damages the tissues in your lungs to the point where your body can’t repair itself anymore. Even secondhand smoke is dangerous.</p>\n\t\t<p>Beyond the dangers of smoking, other risk factors can include:</p>\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t<li>A family history of lung cancer.</li>\n\t\t<li>A history of cancer in another part of your body.</li>\n\t\t<li>Being over the age of 50.</li>\n\t\t<li>Exposure to radon, asbestos or other industrial chemicals.</li>\n\t\t<li>Other diseases in the lungs.</li>\n\t\t<li>Previous radiation therapy.</li>\n\t\t</ul>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t<div class=\"panel panel-default\">\n\t\t<div class=\"panel-heading\" role=\"tab\" id=\"heading12\">\n\t\t<h3 class=\"panel-title\"><a class=\"collapsed\" role=\"button\" data-toggle=\"collapse\" data-parent=\"#accordionTwo\" href=\"#collapse12\" aria-expanded=\"false\" aria-controls=\"collapse12\">Take Preventive Measures</a></h3>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t<div id=\"collapse12\" class=\"panel-collapse collapse\" role=\"tabpanel\" aria-labelledby=\"heading12\">\n\t\t<div class=\"panel-body\">\n\t\t<p>Quitting smoking is the best thing you can do to prevent lung cancer. Quitting at any age can greatly lower your risk for lung cancer.</p>\n\t\t<p>Other ways to prevent lung cancer include:</p>\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t<li><strong> Be aware of chemical exposure.</strong> Talk to your employer about worksite wellness and safety procedures.</li>\n\t\t<li><strong>Have your home tested for radon.</strong> Radon is a natural gas in rock, soil and water.

Together, you can create a screening schedule that’s right for you.</p>\n\t\t<p>Most major insurance plans (including Medicare) cover this screening for people at high risk for lung cancer. You’ll need a doctor's order.</p>\n\t\t<p>Your doctor may recommend a low-dose CT scan if you are age 50-80 who:</p>\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t<li>Currently smokes OR has quit smoking within the last 15 years AND who have a 20 pack-year smoking history.</li>\n\t\t<li>Smoked at least one pack of cigarettes a day for the past 30 years OR smoked at least two packs a day for 15 years.</li>\n\t\t</ul>\n\t\t<div class=\"alert alert-info\">If you would like to schedule a screening, obtain an order from your doctor and call our central scheduling at <a href=\"tel:419-291-3000\">419-291-3000</a> or <a href=\"tel:1-800-479-8805\">1-800-479-8805</a>.</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t",

      "articleContent": "\t\t<h2>About Lymphedema</h2>\n\t\t<p>Lymphedema refers to excessive swelling of one or more extremities following damage to the lymphatic system. The lymphatic system is a complicated system in the body that helps to carry fluid, bacteria and harmful substance through a series of lymph nodes that “clean” the fluid.</p>\n\t\t<p>When lymph nodes are damaged or surgically removed, the system can malfunction and lead to excessive and sometimes uncontrollable swelling in the body. This can often happen as a result of cancer and the treatment associated with it. Lymphedema can be a debilitating disease that has a significant impact on the ability to perform everyday tasks.</p>\n\t\t<hr class=\"divider-green\">\n\t\t<h3>Treating Lymphedema with ProMedica Total Rehab</h3>\n\t\t<h4>How can ProMedica Total Rehab help you?</h4>\n\t\t<p>If you are experiencing any of the symptoms discussed, then lymphedema therapy may be beneficial to you.

It’s important you feel confident in the screening you receive. Talk with your doctor about digital mammography’s enhanced quality and accuracy.</p>\n\t\t<h2 class=\"h2-brand\">How does a digital mammogram work?</h2>\n\t\t<p>As far as your experience, all mammograms are very much alike. You’ll most likely begin regular mammograms between the ages of 35 and 40, younger if there’s a breast cancer history for yourself or your family. Your mammograms are used for both early detection as well as for diagnosis of lumps, breast pain&nbsp;or unusual breast symptoms.</p>\n\t\t<p>During your mammogram, your breast is compressed between two flat surfaces and X-rayed. Digital mammograms display and record the high definition X-ray images on a computer monitor, while a standard film-based mammogram records these images on individual films.</p>\n\t\t<h2 class=\"h2-brand\">What are the benefits of digital mammography?</h2>\n\t\t<p>A few solid benefits for you are:</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"module standard-list\">\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t<li>Less exposure to radiation compared to a standard film-based mammogram.</li>\n\t\t<li>Reduced need for mammogram re-takes means less time spent for you</li>\n\t\t<li>Higher resolution images and image manipulation for accurate detection and diagnosis</li>\n\t\t<li>Your images are stored in computer files for easy access and sharing amongst experts</li>\n\t\t</ul>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t<h2 class=\"h2-brand\">Is a digital mammogram right for you?</h2>\n\t\t<div class=\"module standard-list\">This decision is between you and your doctor, but the common perspective is that digital mammography is better suited for you if you:\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t<li>Are under 50 years old</li>\n\t\t<li>Have dense breasts</li>\n\t\t<li>Haven’t been through menopause or have gone through it within the past year</li>\n\t\t</ul>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t<h2 class=\"h2-brand\">Are digital mammograms available at every ProMedica Radiology location?</h2>\n\t\t<p>We have many convenient locations with this state-of-the-art technique. <a class=\"link-cta\" href=\"/find-locations/location-results?LocationText=digital%20mammography\">Find one near you.</a></p>\n\t\t</div>\n\n\t",

The sound waves reflect off bones and tissues and are analyzed by a computer. This results in an image.</p>\n\t\t<p>Along with a standard ultrasound, your doctor may want you to have a Doppler ultrasound. It evaluates organ and fetal vessel blood flow. In some cases, you may need a vaginal ultrasound to provide more information.</p>\n\t\t<p>A typical ultrasound takes between 30 and 60 minutes. You don’t need to make special preparations, but you may want to wear loose-fitting clothes that can be washed, since a gel-like material is used on your abdomen.</p>\n\t\t<p>Some doctor’s offices limit the number of people who can come to your appointment. Usually one adult is welcome to watch your ultrasound with you.

When you have these signs of labor, call your doctor and family members:</p>\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t<li><strong>Contractions:</strong> Contractions are the shortening of your uterine muscles. They happen before and during childbirth. When they occur less than 10 minutes apart, that usually means labor has started. It’s not unusual to have periodic, irregular contractions as your labor nears.</li>\n\t\t<li><strong>Your water breaks:</strong> The amniotic sac surrounds and protects your unborn baby. When fluid leaks from your vagina, it means the membranes of the sac have ruptured. This can happen hours before labor starts or during labor. Most women go into labor within 24 hours after their water breaks.</li>\n\t\t</ul>\n\t\t<p>It will also help to recognize the stages of labor:</p>\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t<li><strong>Stage one:</strong> The first stage of labor includes latent, active and transition phases. To help your cervix dilate, your contractions will come more and more often until you’re completely dilated (10 centimeters).</li>\n\t\t<li><strong>Stage two:</strong> Stage two begins when the cervix is completely opened. At this point, your doctor will tell you to push. Pushing, along with your contractions, propels your baby through the birth canal. Your baby’s head will crown, and you’ll keep pushing to deliver your baby’s shoulders and body. Once your baby is fully delivered, the umbilical cord is clamped and cut.</li>\n\t\t<li><strong>Stage three:</strong> In the final stage of labor, you’ll deliver the placenta, the organ that nourishes your baby inside your womb.</li>\n\t\t</ul>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t<div class=\"panel panel-default\">\n\t\t<div class=\"panel-heading\" role=\"tab\" id=\"heading14\">\n\t\t<h3 class=\"panel-title\"><a class=\"collapsed\" role=\"button\" data-toggle=\"collapse\" data-parent=\"#accordionTwo\" href=\"#collapse14\" aria-expanded=\"false\" aria-controls=\"collapse14\">Pack Your Bag for the Hospital</a></h3>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t<div id=\"collapse14\" class=\"panel-collapse collapse\" role=\"tabpanel\" aria-labelledby=\"heading14\">\n\t\t<div class=\"panel-body\">\n\t\t<p>Pack a bag for your hospital stay ahead of time.

Planning will also help make sure your C-section goes as smoothly as possible. This planning includes talking to your doctor about anesthesia choices ahead of time to decide on the best one for you if it’s needed. You may also be asked to take blood tests in case an emergency blood transfusion is needed during delivery.</p>\n\t\t<p>Also, plan for your at-home recovery by asking for help from friends, family or a nanny.</p>\n\t\t<p>Some of the ways that a C-section differs from vaginal birth include:</p>\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t<li><strong>Abdominal incision:</strong> The doctor will make an incision through your abdominal wall, usually horizontally near your pubic hairline.</li>\n\t\t<li><strong>Anesthesia:</strong> Anesthesia is used to numb the lower part of your body, which allows you to stay awake during the C-section.</li>\n\t\t<li><strong>Bathing:</strong> For a scheduled C-section, you’ll be asked to shower or bathe the night before with antibacterial soap. This lowers the risk of infection. Your abdomen will be cleaned again at the hospital before your procedure. A tube will be inserted to collect your urine.</li>\n\t\t<li><strong>IV:</strong> An IV will be inserted in your hand or arm to deliver fluids and medicine.</li>\n\t\t<li><strong>Uterine incision:</strong> After your abdominal incision, the doctor will make an incision in your uterus. The uterine incision is usually horizontal across the lower part of your uterus.</li>\n\t\t</ul>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t<div class=\"panel panel-default\">\n\t\t<div class=\"panel-heading\" role=\"tab\" id=\"heading16\">\n\t\t<h3 class=\"panel-title\"><a class=\"collapsed\" role=\"button\" data-toggle=\"collapse\" data-parent=\"#accordionTwo\" href=\"#collapse16\" aria-expanded=\"false\" aria-controls=\"collapse16\">Understand How to Manage Your Pain During Childbirth</a></h3>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t<div id=\"collapse16\" class=\"panel-collapse collapse\" role=\"tabpanel\" aria-labelledby=\"heading16\">\n\t\t<div class=\"panel-body\">\n\t\t<p>You may learn special ways to breathe in childbirth classes or choose to have pain medicine for labor.

      "diagnosis": "<a name=\"diagnosis\"></a>\n\t\t<h2 class=\"alt\">Diagnosing Migraines</h2>\n\t\t<p>A migraine headache is an intense throbbing or pulsing in one area of your head. Migraines sometimes include nausea, vomiting and extreme sensitivity to both light and sound. Often, migraines will have sensory warning symptoms, which include:</p>\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t<li>Blind spots.</li>\n\t\t<li>Flashes of light.</li>\n\t\t<li>Tingling in your arm or leg.</li>\n\t\t</ul>\n\t\t<h3>Get a Thorough Examination and Accurate Diagnosis</h3>\n\t\t<p>Just as there are a number of conditions that could be causing your headache pain, there are a number of diagnostic tools to help us get a clear picture of what’s happening. After gathering your complete medical history and performing a physical, your healthcare provider will help you decide which tests are needed to help diagnose your condition.</p>\n\t\t<p>Common diagnostic procedures include:</p>\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t<li><strong>Blood tests:</strong> These tests are often done to check for other underlying conditions.</li>\n\t\t<li><strong>Computed tomography scan (CT or CAT scan):</strong> A CT scan combines X-rays and computer technology to produce images of the body. These images can show detailed parts of the body, including bones, muscles, fat and organs. CT scans are more detailed than standard X-rays.</li>\n\t\t<li><strong>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI):</strong> An MRI combines large magnets, radiofrequencies and a computer to produce detailed images of organs and structures within the body.</li>\n\t\t<li><strong>Sinus X-rays:</strong> X-ray imaging can find congestion or other problems that may be corrected.</li>\n\t\t<li><strong> Spinal tap (lumbar puncture):</strong> With a spinal tap, a special needle is placed into the spinal canal within the lower back. It measures pressure in the spinal canal and brain. A small amount of cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) is removed and tested to learn if you have an infection or other problems.</li>\n\t\t</ul>\n\t\t",

      "articleContent": "\n\t\t<h2>About Multiple Sclerosis</h2>\n\t\t<p>Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a disease in which your immune system attacks myelin, the covering that protects your nerves. This damage to the myelin disrupts information flow both within your brain and between your brain and the rest of your body. These nerves deteriorate, which is an irreversible condition. MS is a degenerative disease, meaning the symptoms will get progressively worse over time.</p>\n\t\t<h3>MS Symptoms</h3>\n\t\t<p>People with multiple sclerosis usually have their first symptoms between the ages of 20 and 40. Signs and symptoms vary depending on the extent of nerve damage and which nerves are affected. Some Multiple Sclerosis symptoms include:</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"module standard-list\">\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t<li>Blurred vision</li>\n\t\t<li>Loss of balance</li>\n\t\t<li>Poor coordination</li>\n\t\t<li>Slurred speech</li>\n\t\t<li>Tremors</li>\n\t\t<li>Numbness</li>\n\t\t<li>Extreme fatigue</li>\n\t\t<li>Problems with memory and concentration</li>\n\t\t<li>Paralysis</li>\n\t\t<li>Blindness</li>\n\t\t</ul>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t<h3>MS Flare-Ups</h3>\n\t\t<p>You can go days or years without major changes in your symptoms and then suddenly experience a “flare up,” or relapse. MS is active again when you develop new MS symptoms, a regular problem gets worse, or your symptoms last 24 hours or longer.</p>\n\t\t<h3>Causes of Multiple Sclerosis</h3>\n\t\t<p>The cause of MS is currently unknown, but childhood infections and genetics are believed to play a role.There’s no cure, but there are ways to control your symptoms. Since prolonged over-exertion and stress may be contributing factors to flare ups, exercise, regular stretching, and relaxation may help you manage MS symptoms. Talk to your primary physician or neurologist, who may recommend treatments such as physical therapy, muscle relaxants, or medications to reduce fatigue or other symptoms.</p>\n\t",

This functionality allows surgeons to see details that can't be seen with the naked eye and may allow access to brain locations previously deemed inoperable.</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"row\">\n\t\t<div class=\"col-sm-4 col-xs-12\"><img class=\"img-responsive\" src=\"/assets/images/toledo-hospital/neurosciences/neuro-left-brain400x400.jpg\" alt=\"\">&nbsp;</div>\n\t\t<div class=\"col-sm-4 col-xs-12\"><img class=\"img-responsive\" src=\"/assets/images/toledo-hospital/neurosciences/neuro-brain400x400.jpg\" alt=\"\">&nbsp;</div>\n\t\t<div class=\"col-sm-4 col-xs-12\"><img class=\"img-responsive\" src=\"/assets/images/toledo-hospital/neurosciences/neuro-side-brain400x400.jpg\" alt=\"\">&nbsp;</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t<p class=\"callout-mini\">BrightMatter leads to less surgical time and improved&nbsp;patient outcomes.</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"row\">\n\t\t<div class=\"col-sm-6 col-xs-12\">\n\t\t<p><strong>Conditions and diseases treated:</strong></p>\n\t\t<div class=\"standard-list module\">\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t<li><a href=\"/services-and-conditions/brain-aneurysm\">Aneurysms</a></li>\n\t\t<li>Arteriovenous malformations (AVMs)</li>\n\t\t<li>Brain tumors</li>\n\t\t<li>Congenital anomalies</li>\n\t\t<li>Degenerative diseases</li>\n\t\t<li>Infections</li>\n\t\t<li>Injuries and trauma</li>\n\t\t<li>Spine and spinal cord conditions</li>\n\t\t</ul>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t<div class=\"col-sm-6 col-xs-12\">\n\t\t<p><strong>Types of procedures performed:</strong></p>\n\t\t<div class=\"standard-list module\">\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t<li>Craniectomy</li>\n\t\t<li>Craniotomy</li>\n\t\t<li>Discectomy</li>\n\t\t<li>Laminectomy</li>\n\t\t<li>Skull base surgery</li>\n\t\t<li>Spinal fusion</li>\n\t\t</ul>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t<p class=\"callout-mini\">Call <a rel=\"tel\" href=\"tel:+14192914590\">419-291-4590</a> today to schedule an appointment with a neurosurgeon.</p>\n\n\t",

      "articleContent": "\t\t<h2>Understanding Nuclear Medicine</h2>\n\t\t<p>Nuclear medicine is used to determine how an organ is functioning. For example, nuclear medicine can be used to study how a damaged heart is functioning or how blood flow is restricted in parts of the brain. Other organs that can be imaged using nuclear medicine include the liver, kidneys, thyroid, bones, and many others.</p>\n\t\t<p>During a nuclear medicine study, chemicals \"tagged\" with radionuclides that emit gamma rays are injected into the body. The chemicals collect in the area of the body that is to be studied. Images, which may be taken immediately or days after the injection, are obtained by using a gamma camera that detects the gamma rays and produces an image map called a scintigram.</p>\n\t\t<p>Nuclear medicine studies provide information that can help your doctor diagnose and treat diseases in their early stages. Nuclear medicine, using radioactive substances, can also be used to treat certain diseases and conditions, such as overactive thyroid glands or thyroid tumors.</p>\n\t\t<h3>Preparing for a Nuclear Medicine Study</h3>\n\t\t<p>Generally, there are no special preparations that need to be made prior to having a nuclear medicine study. However, certain types of studies may require some preparation. For example, prior to having a thyroid uptake and scan, your doctor may ask that you avoid foods and medications with iodine for one week prior to the test. Your doctor or radiologist can advise you about any special instructions you may need to follow.</p>\n\n\t",

      "articleContent": "\t\t<h2>Understanding Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder</h2>\n\t\t<p>Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a condition where one experiences unreasonable fearful thoughts and performs ritualistic activities in order to manage those thoughts.</p>\n\t\t<p>The frequent disturbing thoughts or images are referred to as <strong>obsessions.</strong> The repetitive rituals performed to try and dispel the obsessions are called <strong>compulsions.</strong> For example: mealtimes, bath, bedtime, and exercise are all positive routine activities. However, OCD rituals are so frequent and intense that they can interfere with your daily life.</p>\n\t\t<hr>\n\t\t<p>The following are examples of <strong>obsessions</strong>:</p>\n\t\t<ul class=\"module standard-list\">\n\t\t<li>Aggressive impulses, thoughts and/or behaviors</li>\n\t\t<li>Counting, thinking about numbers and sequences for long periods of time</li>\n\t\t<li>Excessive fear of something terrible happening</li>\n\t\t<li>Extreme attention to detail</li>\n\t\t<li>Intense preoccupation with dirt and germs</li>\n\t\t<li>Persistent thoughts of performing extremely distasteful sexual acts</li>\n\t\t<li>Preoccupation with perfection, symmetry or order</li>\n\t\t<li>Preoccupation with remembering trivial things</li>\n\t\t<li>Repeated doubts (for example, did I lock the door?)</li>\n\t\t<li>Thoughts about violence towards someone else or their self</li>\n\t\t<li>Thoughts conflicting with religious beliefs</li>\n\t\t</ul>\n\t\t<p>The following are examples of <strong>compulsions</strong>:</p>\n\t\t<ul class=\"module standard-list\">\n\t\t<li>Asking the same question repeatedly</li>\n\t\t<li>Constant checking and rechecking (for example, checking if a door is locked)</li>\n\t\t<li>Excessive counting, recounting and/or grouping</li>\n\t\t<li>Hoarding objects</li>\n\t\t<li>Repeated obscene words or gestures</li>\n\t\t<li>Repeated words, sounds, numbers, and/or music to self</li>\n\t\t<li>Repeated hand-washing (often more than 100 times a day)</li>\n\t\t<li>Repeated words spoken by self or others</li>\n\t\t</ul>\n\t\t<hr>\n\t\t<h3>Causes</h3>\n\t\t<p>The exact cause is unknown, but research suggests that it’s a neurological brain disorder caused by a deficiency of the chemical, serotonin, in the brain. OCD tends to run in families.</p>\n\t\t<h3>OCD in Children and Adolescents</h3>\n\t\t<p>If you believe your child has OCD, contact your pediatrician to set up an appointment for evaluation. If further assessment is needed, your pediatrician may recommend evaluation by a licensed behavioral health professional. OCD can be effectively treated, usually with a combination of individual therapy and medication.</p>\n\n\t",

It occurs when the cartilage in a joint breaks down due to “wear and tear” over time. This can result from overuse during a job or athletic activities. When the cartilage is damaged or gone completely, moving a joint can cause pain and friction between joints.</p>\n\t\t<h3>Can osteoarthritis be treated?</h3>\n\t\t<p>If you have osteoarthritis, talk to your doctor about treatment options. With a prescription from your physician, <a href=\"/services-and-conditions/physical-therapy\">physical</a> and <a href=\"/services-and-conditions/occupational-therapy\">occupational therapy</a> can be an effective method of treatment. We believe that regular weight bearing exercise, strengthening and stretching can help to reduce or alleviate pain and improve your day to day function.</p>\n\t\t<h3>How can ProMedica Total Rehab help you?</h3>\n\t\t<p>At ProMedica Total Rehab, we are committed to helping you regain the skills and strength you need to get back to doing what you love.

In addition to movement problems, there may also be neuropsychiatric and non-motor symptoms.

This recognition puts us in the company of fewer than a dozen organizations in the United States to achieve this certification. We meet the highest national standards for quality and safety in asthma diagnosis, treatment and education.</p>\n\t\t<p>Childhood asthma in Lucas County is widespread. It affects 5% of children under the age of five, 15% of children under the age of 11, and 21% of children in grades 6 through 12. Of children diagnosed with asthma, 32% are African American.</p>\n\t\t<p>At ProMedica Ebeid Children’s Hospital, the goal of our asthma program is to help minimize the frequency and severity of a child’s symptoms. Working directly with affected children and their families, we help them understand and manage their condition. This reduces their risk for emergency room and hospital visits, and improves quality of life. Our patient care program offers a wide spectrum of services and support, including:</p>\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t<li>Controller medicines to decrease symptoms and prevent asthma attacks.</li>\n\t\t<li>Education on personal asthma triggers, such as allergies, smoke, exercise and cold air.</li>\n\t\t<li>How to understand the differences among medicines and how to take the right one at the right time.</li>\n\t\t<li>Personalized Asthma Action Plans to help monitor and manage symptoms and document key healthcare contacts.

There are many different conditions that can cause chronic pelvic pain. And symptoms can vary widely from person to person — from pain that comes and goes to severe and steady pain.</p>\n\t\t<p>Just as each person is unique, so is each case. While some describe chronic pelvic pain as a dull ache or heaviness in the pelvis, others have cramping and sharper bouts of pain. Whatever your experience is, when your pain causes you to miss work and lose sleep or avoid activities you love, it’s time to get medical attention.</p>\n\t\t<p>Working with a pelvic health specialist, you can pinpoint the source of your pain and come up with a care plan that offers relief.</p>\n\t\t<p class=\"pro-callout pro-callout--purple\">1 in 3 women of childbearing age have chronic pelvic pain.</p>\n\t\t<h3>Causes of Chronic Pelvic Pain</h3>\n\t\t<div class=\"panel-group\" id=\"accordion\" role=\"tablist\" aria-multiselectable=\"true\">\n\t\t<div class=\"panel panel-default\">\n\t\t<div class=\"panel-heading\" role=\"tab\" id=\"heading1\">\n\t\t<h3 class=\"panel-title\"><a class=\"collapsed\" role=\"button\" data-toggle=\"collapse\" data-parent=\"#accordion\" href=\"#collapse1\" aria-expanded=\"false\" aria-controls=\"collapse1\">Endometriosis</a></h3>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t<div id=\"collapse1\" class=\"panel-collapse collapse\" role=\"tabpanel\" aria-labelledby=\"heading1\">\n\t\t<div class=\"panel-body\">\n\t\t<p>Endometriosis happens when tissue that normally grows inside your uterus, grows on the outside. While we still don’t know the exact cause, we know its risk factors. These include:</p>\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t<li>A family history of endometriosis (blood relative).</li>\n\t\t<li>Any condition that prevents normal menstrual flow.</li>\n\t\t<li>Going through menopause at an older age.</li>\n\t\t<li>Higher levels of estrogen in the body.</li>\n\t\t<li>Heavy periods that last longer than seven days.</li>\n\t\t<li>Low body mass index.</li>\n\t\t<li>Never giving birth.</li>\n\t\t<li>Reproductive tract problems.</li>\n\t\t<li>Short menstrual cycles (less than 27 days).</li>\n\t\t<li>Starting your period at an early age.</li>\n\t\t</ul>\n\t\t<p>We’ve also been able to pinpoint common symptoms; the most telling seem to be chronic pelvic pain, painful intercourse or difficult periods.</p>\n\t\t<p>Endometriosis is usually diagnosed after your doctor does a pelvic exam. You may also need to have an ultrasound or MRI. In some cases, your doctor may use minimally invasive surgery (laparoscopy) to check for signs of endometriosis.</p>\n\t\t<p>Treatment for endometriosis can include pain medicine, hormone therapy or surgery. The type of treatment you receive will depend on your symptoms and whether you want to have children. Your doctor will work with you to decide on the best treatment for your needs.</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t<div class=\"panel panel-default\">\n\t\t<div class=\"panel-heading\" role=\"tab\" id=\"heading2\">\n\t\t<h3 class=\"panel-title\"><a class=\"collapsed\" role=\"button\" data-toggle=\"collapse\" data-parent=\"#accordion\" href=\"#collapse2\" aria-expanded=\"false\" aria-controls=\"collapse2\">Pelvic Congestion Syndrome</a></h3>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t<div id=\"collapse2\" class=\"panel-collapse collapse\" role=\"tabpanel\" aria-labelledby=\"heading2\">\n\t\t<div class=\"panel-body\">\n\t\t<p>Veins that are weak can cause blood to build up, and this pooling can lead to varicose veins. When varicose veins develop in your pelvis and cause chronic pelvic pain, we call it pelvic congestion syndrome.</p>\n\t\t<p>This syndrome usually affects women of childbearing age, women who’ve had two or more pregnancies or women with a family history of vein problems.</p>\n\t\t<p>The main symptom of pelvic congestion syndrome is chronic pelvic pain, but you also could have an urge to urinate more often, develop hemorrhoids or notice varicose veins on the outside of your genitals or on your inner thighs.</p>\n\t\t<p>If your doctor thinks you have pelvic congestion syndrome, you’ll have a physical exam. Then you may need to have an ultrasound or CT scan to confirm the diagnosis.</p>\n\t\t<p>Treatment usually involves taking hormone medicines, and sometimes minimally invasive surgery.</p>\n\t\t<p><a href=\"/services-and-conditions/pelvic-congestion-syndrome\">Learn more about pelvic congestion syndrome</a>.</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t<div class=\"panel panel-default\">\n\t\t<div class=\"panel-heading\" role=\"tab\" id=\"heading3\">\n\t\t<h3 class=\"panel-title\"><a class=\"collapsed\" role=\"button\" data-toggle=\"collapse\" data-parent=\"#accordion\" href=\"#collapse3\" aria-expanded=\"false\" aria-controls=\"collapse3\">Pelvic Floor Disorders</a></h3>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t<div id=\"collapse3\" class=\"panel-collapse collapse\" role=\"tabpanel\" aria-labelledby=\"heading3\">\n\t\t<div class=\"panel-body\">\n\t\t<p>The muscles, ligaments and nerves at the bottom of your pelvis make up what we call “your pelvic floor.” You may have a pelvic floor disorder if you notice changes in your normal habits.

We can perform many treatments, including minor procedures, right in our office. Our treatments include:</p>\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t<li><strong>Custom foot orthotics:</strong> Orthotics are special shoe inserts that support your feet and restore normal foot function. They’re custom-made for your foot using a digital image, foam impression or plaster casting.</li>\n\t\t<li><strong>Diagnostic ultrasound:</strong> An ultrasound uses sound waves to create an image of the foot or ankle. It helps us diagnose soft tissue issues such as tendonitis, tendon tears, plantar fasciitis and cysts.</li>\n\t\t<li><strong>Minor office surgeries:</strong> Our office is equipped to perform many minor surgeries. Under local anesthesia, your foot doctor can safely correct ingrown or fungal nails, remove warts or bone spurs and relax tight tendons and joints.</li>\n\t\t<li><strong>PADnet testing:</strong> PADnet testing checks the blood circulation in your legs and feet. It can help detect blockages caused by <a href=\"/services-and-conditions/peripheral-artery-disease-pad\">peripheral artery disease</a> (PAD). A person with PAD has a higher risk of stroke, heart attack and serious foot problems.</li>\n\t\t<li><strong>Sural nerve conduction study:</strong> This study can help us diagnose diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN). Neuropathy, or nerve damage, in the legs and feet can cause numbness, tingling and pain. It’s often one of the first symptoms of diabetes. This test gives results in less than one minute and can find signs of neuropathy even when symptoms are minor.</li>\n\t\t<li><strong>X-rays:</strong> Our office uses high-speed, low-dose X-rays to help find and diagnose fractures, bone spurs, arthritis and other bone problems in the feet and ankles. We take and process X-rays during your visit to quickly and efficiently diagnose your condition.</li>\n\t\t</ul>\n\t\t",

It’s commonly requested in order to provide more information about how the following organs and tissues are working:</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"module standard-list\">\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t<li>Brain</li>\n\t\t<li>Heart</li>\n\t\t<li>Lung</li>\n\t\t<li>Breast</li>\n\t\t</ul>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t<h3>How does a PET scan work?</h3>\n\t\t<p>During your PET, you’ll be injected with a small amount of radioactive material, called a tracer. This tracer travels throughout your body and collects in your organs and tissues, giving your radiologist a highlighted view of the area under examination.</p>\n\t\t<p>In order for your radiologist to assess your body’s function, you’ll lie still on a table and pass through a tunnel-like machine. This machine will detect the tracer and transform the signals into the image your radiologist will assess.</p>\n\t\t<h3>Why is a PET scan important to your health?</h3>\n\t\t<p>Generally, a PET gives your doctor a much more complete picture as to the origin or causes of symptoms you might have. Clear information means concise treatment; and focused treatment gives you the best opportunity to improve your health. Also, a PET can have results that indicate that your body is functioning just as it should, therefore ruling out serious conditions.</p>\n\n\t",

      "articleContent": "\t\t<h2>Understanding Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder</h2>\n\t\t<p>Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a condition that occurs after one experiences an emotionally or physically frightening event. The person is so affected by the ordeal that they develop frequent memories or flashbacks of it. When exposed to situations that resemble the traumatic event, they undergo severe emotional, mental and physical distress.</p>\n\t\t<p>PTSD symptoms can start soon following the event and improve shortly after or they may persist long-term.</p>\n\t\t<h3>Common PTSD Symptoms</h3>\n\t\t<p>Signs vary, but you may notice any, or all, of the following:</p>\n\t\t<ul class=\"module standard-list\">\n\t\t<li>Avoiding certain situations or places</li>\n\t\t<li>Depression</li>\n\t\t<li>Difficulty concentrating</li>\n\t\t<li>Experiencing physical discomfort (headaches, stomachaches)</li>\n\t\t<li>Fearing death at an early age</li>\n\t\t<li>Having frequent flashbacks or intrusive memories</li>\n\t\t<li>Irritability</li>\n\t\t<li>Loss of interest in activities you used to enjoy</li>\n\t\t<li>Lost touch with reality</li>\n\t\t<li>Having nightmares</li>\n\t\t<li>Trouble at work or in school</li>\n\t\t</ul>\n\t\t<h3>Events That Trigger PTSD</h3>\n\t\t<p>Specific examples of events which typically cause PTSD:</p>\n\t\t<ul class=\"module standard-list\">\n\t\t<li>Abuse – physical or emotional</li>\n\t\t<li>Animal bites</li>\n\t\t<li>Automobile accidents</li>\n\t\t<li>Experiencing a natural disaster (such as a flood or hurricane)</li>\n\t\t<li>Invasive medical procedures</li>\n\t\t<li>Man-made tragedies (bombings and shootings)</li>\n\t\t<li>Neglect</li>\n\t\t<li>Sexual assault or molestation</li>\n\t\t<li>Violent attacks (mugging, torture, kidnapping, being held captive)</li>\n\t\t</ul>\n\t\t<p>If you believe you may have PTSD, schedule an appointment with a provider who works in behavioral health. Counselors, therapists, psychologists, and psychiatrists are all examples of providers who may be able to help diagnose and treat your PTSD.</p>\n\t\t<h3>PTSD in Children and Adolescents</h3>\n\t\t<p>Children and adolescents can suffer from PTSD. A child with PTSD will exhibit many of the same symptoms that an adult might. In addition to the standard symptoms, children may also begin acting younger than their age (thumb-sucking, wetting the bed). Many times, PTSD started during childhood develops into a chronic disorder. However, PTSD can be treated with therapy.</p>\n\t\t<p class=\"pro-callout pro-callout--purple\">Can PTSD be prevented? As a parent, you may be able to reduce the risk of traumatic experiences in your child.</p>\n\t\t<h4>Preventing PTSD in Children and Adolescents</h4>\n\t\t<ul class=\"module standard-list\">\n\t\t<li>Teach your child to say NO to someone who tries to touch them inappropriately or make them uncomfortable.</li>\n\t\t<li>Offer support and counseling to children who have undergone a traumatic experience.</li>\n\t\tSupport prevention programs within your community and at your child’s school.</ul>\n\t\t<p>If you suspect your child may have PTSD, contact your pediatrician for a proper evaluation. If further assessment is needed, your pediatrician may recommend a comprehensive evaluation by a licensed behavioral health professional.</p>\n\n\t",

It can help you make more informed decisions about your care.</p>\n\t\t<p>Prostate cancer, second only to skin cancer, is the most common cancer in American men. The American Cancer Society estimates that there will be more than 174,000 new cases of prostate cancer diagnosed yearly.</p>\n\t\t<p>The prostate is a gland located below the bladder and in front of the rectum. It produces a fluid that together with other fluids produces sperm. The prostate is about the size of a walnut, but can be much larger in older men. Almost all prostate cancers are adenocarcinomas, which are cancers that start in gland cells.</p>\n\t\t<p>Prostate cancer grows slowly. If confined to the prostate, it may not cause any serious damage. Prostate is less likely than other cancers to spread (metastasize) to other parts of the body.</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"panel-group\" id=\"accordionTwo\" role=\"tablist\" aria-multiselectable=\"true\">\n\t\t<div class=\"panel panel-default\">\n\t\t<div class=\"panel-heading\" role=\"tab\" id=\"heading11\">\n\t\t<h3 class=\"panel-title\"><a class=\"collapsed\" role=\"button\" data-toggle=\"collapse\" data-parent=\"#accordionTwo\" href=\"#collapse11\" aria-expanded=\"false\" aria-controls=\"collapse11\">Know Your Risk</a></h3>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t<div id=\"collapse11\" class=\"panel-collapse collapse\" role=\"tabpanel\" aria-labelledby=\"heading11\">\n\t\t<div class=\"panel-body\">\n\t\t<p>One in nine men will be diagnosed with prostate cancer during his lifetime. But the good news is that, as with most cancers, the earlier you catch it, the easier it is to treat.</p>\n\t\t<p>Since you may not show signs or symptoms, especially if your prostate cancer is in its early stages, knowing you’re at higher risk can help you stay on top of taking preventive measures and having regular screenings.</p>\n\t\t<p>Men may have a higher risk for prostate cancer if they:</p>\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t<li>Are African American.</li>\n\t\t<li>Are over age 65.</li>\n\t\t<li>Have a family history of prostate cancer.</li>\n\t\t<li>Live in North America, northwest Europe, Australia or Caribbean Islands.</li>\n\t\t</ul>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t<div class=\"panel panel-default\">\n\t\t<div class=\"panel-heading\" role=\"tab\" id=\"heading12\">\n\t\t<h3 class=\"panel-title\"><a class=\"collapsed\" role=\"button\" data-toggle=\"collapse\" data-parent=\"#accordionTwo\" href=\"#collapse12\" aria-expanded=\"false\" aria-controls=\"collapse12\">Recognize the Symptoms</a></h3>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t<div id=\"collapse12\" class=\"panel-collapse collapse\" role=\"tabpanel\" aria-labelledby=\"heading12\">\n\t\t<div class=\"panel-body\">\n\t\t<p>Since symptoms aren’t easy to notice, especially in the early stages, prostate cancer can sneak up on you.

This is often performed along with a prostate biopsy.</p>\n\t\t<h4>Prostate Biopsy</h4>\n\t\t<p>Tiny pieces of prostate tissue are removed using small needles. They are checked for cancer cells.

      "articleContent": "\n\t\t<h2>Understanding Pelvic Congestion Syndrome</h2>\n\t\t<p>Chronic <a href=\"/services-and-conditions/pelvic-pain\">pelvic pain</a>, defined as pain lasting six months or more, affects 15% of women in America. Many issues can cause this pain. But, did you know that a vascular problem could be one of them?</p>\n\t\t<p>Pelvic congestion syndrome (PCS) is a condition that causes chronic pelvic pain due to problems with your veins in your lower abdomen. Veins carry blood from all areas of your body back to the heart. However, in some women, the veins in the lower abdomen have weakened, making their veins inefficient at moving the blood back up to their heart. This allows blood to build up or pool, causing pressure and bulging veins resulting in varicose veins in the pelvis.</p>\n\t\t<p>Some sub-types of pelvic congestion syndrome include ovarian vein reflux, nutcracker syndrome, and May-Thurner syndrome.</p>\n\t\t<hr>\n\t\t<div class=\"row\">\n\t\t<div class=\"col-xs-12 col-sm-6\">\n\t\t<h4>New Procedure Offers Speedier Recovery for Patients with Nutcracker Syndrome</h4>\n\t\t<div class=\"responsive-video\"><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/DeVyzgrxO7E?enablejsapi=1\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t<div class=\"row\">\n\t\t<h3>Who is at risk for pelvic congestion syndrome?</h3>\n\t\t<p>PCS mostly effects women of childbearing age. It is also common in women who have had two or more pregnancies and those who have a family history of venous disease.</p>\n\t\t<h3>What are the symptoms of pelvic congestion syndrome?</h3>\n\t\t<p>The main symptom of pelvic congestion syndrome is pelvic pain that lasts at least six months. Often, the pain starts during or after a pregnancy. Many women describe the pain as a severe, dull ache that worsens around the time of their menstrual period. Others describe the pain as heavy or sharp.</p>\n\t\t<p><strong>Other symptoms include:</strong></p>\n\t\t<ul class=\"standard-list module\">\n\t\t<li>Pain before or during a heavy menstrual flow</li>\n\t\t<li>Frequent urge to urinate</li>\n\t\t<li>Varicose veins on the external genitals, thighs and/or hemorrhoids</li>\n\t\t</ul>\n\t\t<p><strong>Activities that can worsen the pain include:</strong></p>\n\t\t<ul class=\"standard-list module\">\n\t\t<li>Changing your posture</li>\n\t\t<li>Having sexual intercourse (pain can occur both during and after)</li>\n\t\t<li>Standing or sitting for long periods of time</li>\n\t\t<li>Traveling on long automobile trips or flights</li>\n\t\t<li>Walking</li>\n\t\t</ul>\n\t\t<h3>How is pelvic congestion syndrome diagnosed?</h3>\n\t\t<p>Pelvic pain is not easy to diagnose. Your primary care provider (PCP) or gynecologist will need to consider the many possible causes of pelvic pain, including problems with your reproductive, urinary or gastrointestinal systems. To diagnose, your doctor will typically obtain a complete medical history, perform an abdominal and pelvic exam, Pap smear, and order blood work.</p>\n\t\t<p>After ruling out other pelvic problems, a vascular expert like the ones at <a href=\"/services-and-conditions/vascular-care/vascular-institute\">Jobst Vascular Institute</a> may be consulted. This specialist may recommend additional testing such as:</p>\n\t\t<ul class=\"standard-list module\">\n\t\t<li><a href=\"/services-and-conditions/ultrasound\">Ultrasound </a>– A Doppler ultrasound to check the blood flow in the pelvic blood vessels.</li>\n\t\t<li><a href=\"/services-and-conditions/computed-tomography-ct-scan\">Computed tomography (CT)</a> or <a href=\"/services-and-conditions/magnetic-resonance-imaging-mri\">magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) </a>– Imaging that provides more detailed pictures of your pelvic veins.</li>\n\t\t</ul>\n\t\t<h3>What are the next steps?</h3>\n\t\t<p>Once you have been diagnosed with PCS, know that today more treatments than ever are available. Your gynecologist may prescribe hormone medications to relieve pain. Your gynecologist may also recommend that you talk with a Jobst vascular surgeon for additional treatment options. Most of these treatments are minimally invasive and can be performed in an outpatient setting.</p>\n\t\t<p class=\"pro-callout pro-callout--purple\">To learn more about treatment options, call Jobst Vascular Institute Vein Care at <a rel=\"tel\" href=\"tel:4192912090\">877-551-VEIN (419-291-2090)</a>.</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t",

The initial evaluation typically includes:</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"module standard-list\">\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t<li>Checking the motor control, strength, and endurance of core support muscles</li>\n\t\t<li>Assessing your pelvic floor muscle coordination for different activities and positions</li>\n\t\t<li>Other testing, as needed.</li>\n\t\t</ul>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t<p>Based on the findings of this exam, the physical therapist creates a unique treatment plan to help you improve your pelvic floor function. The treatment plan may include working with you on behavioral approaches such as bladder re-training techniques. Plus, an individualized physical therapy regimen to help rehab your pelvic floor muscles. The physical therapist may use a variety of techniques. Specific treatments help to improve urinary and/or fecal continence.</p>\n\t\t<hr class=\"divider-green\">\n\t\t<h3>Pelvic floor physical therapy is NOT…</h3>\n\t\t<div class=\"module standard-list\">\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t<li>Just for women. Men, women and children suffer from pelvic floor disorders and could benefit from therapy.</li>\n\t\t<li>Just massage and kegels. A variety of techniques are used to treat patients.</li>\n\t\t<li>Evaluation or treatment involving speculums or stirrups—neither is used in pelvic floor physical therapy</li>\n\t\t<li>A “one size fits all” program. Treatment is uniquely designed to your specific needs.</li>\n\t\t</ul>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t<h3>How can pelvic floor physical therapy help me?</h3>\n\t\t<p>The treatments used by our pelvic floor physical therapists are designed to address issues with the structures of the pelvic floor (i.e. nerves, lymphatics, muscles, connective tissue, skin, and bones). Pelvic floor physical therapy exercises and treatments aim to improve:</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"module standard-list\">\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t<li>The leakage of urine or loss of bladder control</li>\n\t\t<li>Painful sex and vaginal pain</li>\n\t\t<li>Sexual dysfunction (male and female)</li>\n\t\t<li>Pelvic pain and discomfort in the vaginal area with or without sexual interactions</li>\n\t\t<li>Pelvic organ prolapse (the dropping of the bladder, rectum or uterus)</li>\n\t\t<li>Constipation or incomplete bowel or bladder emptying</li>\n\t\t<li>Back, hip or sacroiliac joint (SI) pain that has not improved with time or traditional treatment</li>\n\t\t</ul>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t<p class=\"pro-callout pro-callout--purple\">Talk to a specialist; call <a href=\"tel:1-419-824-1968\">419-824-1968</a> to schedule an appointment today.</p>\n\t\t<h3>What should I expect when I visit the pelvic floor physical therapist?</h3>\n\t\t<p>Our certified and well-trained therapists welcome you in a comfortable and friendly environment. We also believe in a team approach to care so that you are in control of your treatment.</p>\n\t\t<p>At your first visit, we’ll do an initial evaluation that lasts about 60 minutes. This evaluation typically includes:</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"module standard-list\">\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t<li>A detailed discussion including an explanation of your medical history and your condition</li>\n\t\t<li>Checking the motor control, strength, and endurance of core support muscles</li>\n\t\t<li>Assessing your pelvic floor muscle coordination for different activities and positions</li>\n\t\t<li>An external and external and internal assessment of your pelvic floor function including strength, coordination, tone, and sensation</li>\n\t\t</ul>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t<p>Based on the findings of this exam, we’ll create a unique treatment plan to help you improve your pelvic floor function. The treatment plan may include working with you on behavioral approaches such as bladder re-training techniques. Plus, an individualized physical therapy regimen to help rehab your pelvic floor muscles. The physical therapist may use a variety of techniques specific to your needs.</p>\n\t\t<hr class=\"divider-green\">\n\t\t<h2>Kegels and More for Your Pelvic Health</h2>\n\t\t<p>Pelvic floor physical therapist may utilize a number of different therapies to treat chronic pelvic pain and pelvic floor disorders, including:</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"module standard-list\">\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t<li>Stretching exercises, massage and other relaxation techniques</li>\n\t\t<li>Kegel exercises: Regular, daily exercise of pelvic muscles can make the pelvic floor muscles stronger and improve, and even prevent, urinary incontinence.</li>\n\t\t<li>Biofeedback: Uses different types of devices to give information on how well pelvic muscles are contracting. The message or “feedback” can help improve awareness and control of pelvic floor muscles. This is often used along with Kegel exercises to help patients gain awareness and control of the pelvic muscles.</li>\n\t\t<li>Vaginal weight training: Small weights are held within the vagina by tightening the vaginal muscles.</li>\n\t\t<li>Pelvic floor electrical stimulation: Mild electrical pulses stimulate muscle contractions. This may be done along with Kegel exercises.</li>\n\t\t</ul>\n\t\t</div>\n\n\t",

      "articleContent": "\n\t\t<h2>Using Radiation Therapy to Treat Cancer</h2>\n\t\t<p>Radiation therapy is the use of high-energy X-rays to treat cancer. These are therapeutic X-rays, which are different from diagnostic X-rays. Radiation can be an effective cancer treatment and is designed to prevent cancer cells from growing and multiplying. The goal is to slow or stop tumor growth and, in many cases, completely destroy the tumor.</p>\n\t\t<p>Your radiation therapy treatment is administered in stages. You’re supported by experienced professionals and caregivers along the way.</p>\n\t\t<p><strong>What are the steps to radiation therapy treatment?</strong></p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t<li><strong>Your first visit.</strong>&nbsp;This is a consultation to discuss your cancer and treatment options with your <a href=\"#providers\" title=\"radiation oncologists list\">radiation oncologist</a>. This is a time to ask questions. If possible, bring a family member.</li>\n\t\t<li><strong>Simulation.</strong>&nbsp;Your radiation oncologist uses X-ray equipment called a “simulator” to aid in your treatment plan. Sometimes, a non-toxic dye is injected in order to outline certain organs. Prior to the simulation, your radiation therapist places you into a special positioning device that will hold your body still during treatment.</li>\n\t\t<li><strong>Planning marks.</strong>&nbsp;During your simulation, you’re given either small black permanent marks, about the size of a freckle, or similarly sized semi-permanent marks. These marks create a focal point for the radiation treatment machine so treatment can be given to precisely the same spot each time.</li>\n\t\t<li><strong>Receiving treatments.</strong>&nbsp;A machine called a “linear accelerator” provides your therapeutic radiation dosages. You’ll lie on a table, sometimes shielded by protective blocks, and will be raised under the linear accelerator. The treatment machine will move to a predetermined position and apply the radiation treatment. You won’t feel or see the radiation. Expect weekly assessments while you’re given treatment to see how your body responds.</li>\n\t\t<li><strong>Follow-up care.</strong>&nbsp;It’s extremely important to schedule regular exams after you’ve finished your radiation treatment. This may include blood work and X-rays. Continue to maintain a healthy lifestyle after your treatment is complete.</li>\n\t\t</ul>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t<p><strong>What are the side effects of radiation therapy?</strong>&nbsp;Side effects differ, depending on the treatment area. The most common are fatigue and skin irritation. Your doctor or nurse will discuss ways to prevent or minimize these effects with you, including&nbsp;nutrition for managing fatigue.</p>\n\t",

This includes degenerative conditions such as osteoarthritis, as well as tendon and ligament tears.</p>\n\t\t<p><strong>Ankle ligament tears</strong>: Ankle sprains often cause stretched or torn ligaments. This can change how you walk and put painful stress on foot joints, increasing your risk for another ankle sprain. This incomplete healing leads to a cycle of chronic pain and instability. Regenerative medicine may promote healing in damaged ligaments and improve function and mobility.</p>\n\t\t<p><strong>Ankle osteoarthritis</strong>: Osteoarthritis of the ankle leads to tenderness, pain, swelling, stiffness and even an inability to bear weight. This can change how you walk, increase stress on the foot and may lead to injury. Regenerative medicine may tighten and stabilize your ankle for better function and mobility.</p>\n\t\t<p><strong>Ankle tendon tears</strong>: Damage to the Achilles tendon is the most common form of tendon damage. It often results from acute injury or overuse often as a result of athletics. Regenerative medicine may promote repair of strains and tears to the Achilles tendon.</p>\n\t\t<p><strong>Toe osteoarthritis</strong>: This condition can cause toes to bend sideways and create painful bone spurs.

Regenexx may treat injuries and degenerative problems related to the hand or wrist.</p>\n\t\t<p><strong>TFCC tear</strong>: The triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) contributes to use of our opposable thumbs. Wear or injury can lead to wrist pain and swelling. Regenerative medicine may reduce pain and discomfort and help restore function.</p>\n\t\t<p><strong>Carpal tunnel syndrome</strong>: Roughly 5% of people in the workplace have carpal tunnel syndrome. This condition causes pain, numbness, or tingling in the thumb, index finger, middle finger, and inside of the ring finger. Regenerative medicine may loosen the pinching and restore function.</p>\n\t\t<p><strong>Thumb Osteoarthritis</strong>: Hand and thumb osteoarthritis is the second most common type of arthritis. Movements from writing, using a phone, and other daily activities cause the cartilage to wear down. Regenerative medicine may help stabilize the thumb joint for better function and mobility.

To relieve knee pain, you must first figure out what’s causing the pain. Knee pain can be caused by an acute injury or by chronic wear and tear of the knee, such as osteoarthritis or degenerative joint disease. Common knee conditions include:</p>\n\t\t<p><strong>Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) tears</strong>: There are numerous types of ACL tears. Some may require surgical repair, but many may be treated with regenerative medicine.</p>\n\t\t<p><strong>Knee osteoarthritis</strong>: Knee osteoarthritis (OA) is one of the most common orthopaedic conditions. If can negatively impact your quality of life and enjoyment of daily activities. Your doctor can help determine if you are a candidate for regenerative medicine.</p>\n\t\t<p><strong>Meniscus tears</strong>: The meniscus is a cushion of cartilage between the bony ends of your thigh bone and shin bone. This cartilage acts as a shock absorber during movement. Tears of the meniscus can be the result of wear and tear on the joint or can occur when there’s an injury.</p>\n\t\t<p>Some knee conditions need rest and/or special exercises prescribed by a physical therapist. If pain or function does not improve, it may require advanced medical attention. Our experts are highly trained in diagnosing and treating knee issues. Regenexx procedures may help improve knee function, but in some cases, surgery may be the best solution.</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t<div class=\"panel panel-default\">\n\t\t<div class=\"panel-heading\" role=\"tab\" id=\"heading5\">\n\t\t<h3 class=\"panel-title\"><a class=\"collapsed\" role=\"button\" data-toggle=\"collapse\" data-parent=\"#accordion\" href=\"#collapse5\" aria-expanded=\"false\" aria-controls=\"collapse5\">Shoulder</a></h3>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t<div id=\"collapse5\" class=\"panel-collapse collapse\" role=\"tabpanel\" aria-labelledby=\"heading5\">\n\t\t<div class=\"panel-body\">\n\t\t<p>The shoulder joint is the most mobile joint in your body. When there's an injury or degenerative disease, your body struggles to keep the joint stable. Tendons and ligaments may stretch or tear due to trauma, or simply wear out due to age. This allows too much motion in the joint. The added motion may lead to bone spurs or arthritis.</p>\n\t\t<p>Common conditions affecting the shoulder include:</p>\n\t\t<p><strong>Rotator cuff tears</strong>: The rotator cuff is a series of muscles and their tendons that surround the shoulder. It helps move the shoulder while supporting this ball in the socket joint. The tendons can become torn with trauma or wear and tear. This can cause pain and weakness in the shoulder. An MRI or ultrasound image is used to make the diagnosis.</p>\n\t\t<p><strong>Labrum tears / SLAP tears</strong>: The labrum is a cup-shape rim of cartilage that lines and reinforces the ball-and-socket joint of the shoulder. A direct injury to the shoulder or prolonged wear and tear may lead to a shoulder labrum tear. Regenerative medicine procedures may help treat these tears.</p>\n\t\t<p><strong>Shoulder osteoarthritis and degeneration</strong>: The cartilage in your shoulder cushions the bone and reduces friction. Arthritis occurs when this cartilage starts to wear down or is injured. This leads to chronic shoulder pain, stiffness, limited shoulder function, and decreased mobility. Shoulder arthritis impacts nearly 25% of adults.

The therapists identify and treat problems that keep you from moving naturally and performing daily activities.</p>\n\t\t<p>Once your doctor refers you to <a href=\"/services-and-conditions/physical-therapy\">physical therapy</a>, our therapists will work closely with you and your doctor to design a plan of care that will achieve your best possible outcome in recovery. Our goal is to help you move, reduce pain, restore function and prevent disability.</p>\n\t\t<h3>Occupational Therapy</h3>\n\t\t<p><a href=\"/services-and-conditions/occupational-therapy\">Occupational therapists</a> use everyday activities as therapy for people who are ill, injured or disabled. They help their patients develop, recover and improve the skills needed for daily living and working.</p>\n\t\t<p>You may see an occupational therapist if you’ve had a joint replacement, have a neurological disease or have had a <a href=\"/services-and-conditions/stroke\">stroke</a>. This type of therapy is based on your health and your goals, but it can include everything from learning how to use utensils again to going back to the workforce.</p>\n\t\t<h3>Speech Therapy</h3>\n\t\t<p>Our licensed speech-language pathologists assess and treat problems with <a href=\"/services-and-conditions/speech-therapy\">speech, language, communication and swallowing</a>. Speech and language disorders may be something a person is born with or they may be caused by a stroke or neurological condition. Children with speech disorders often have impaired hearing or developmental delays. At ProMedica, we treat children and adults with expert, compassionate care.</p>\n\t\t<h3>Aquatic Therapy</h3>\n\t\t<p>If you’re recovering from an injury, surgery or illness and dealing with pain or weakness that makes it hard to exercise, aquatic therapy may be right for you. <a href=\"/services-and-conditions/aquatic-therapy\">Aquatic therapy</a> is especially helpful for people with arthritis, joint swelling or other conditions that keep them from doing high-impact, weight-bearing activities.</p>\n\t\t<h3>Lymphedema Therapy</h3>\n\t\t<p>Certain illnesses or therapies, such as cancer treatment, can lead to excessive swelling in the extremities. This condition, caused by a damaged lymphatic system, is called lymphedema. <a href=\"/services-and-conditions/lymphedema-therapy\">Lymphedema therapy</a> can help reduce swelling, pain and the risk of infection. It can also help you keep up with your normal activities. Lymphedema therapy can take many forms, including massage, specialized skin care and compression wrapping.</p>\n\t\t<p>The experienced therapists at ProMedica can:</p>\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t<li>Educate you about self-care.</li>\n\t\t<li>Provide techniques to reduce swelling.</li>\n\t\t<li>Help improve daily functions.</li>\n\t\t</ul>\n\t\t<h3>Sports Medicine</h3>\n\t\t<p>ProMedica <a href=\"/services-and-conditions/sports-medicine\">sports medicine</a> therapists will design a personal treatment plan to fit your fitness, mobility and strength goals. Our multidisciplinary team of rehabilitation experts knows how to restore your function as quickly as possible.</p>\n\t\t<h3>Pediatric Rehabilitation</h3>\n\t\t<p>Our pediatric therapy team is made up of occupational, physical and speech therapists who specialize in pediatric care. We help children with congenital or acquired neurological, developmental or orthopedic problems. Therapists go alongside your child to help improve motor, sensory and communication skills. They also assist with adaptive equipment needs.</p>\n\t\t<p>We believe rehabilitation can be a family-centered journey. A personal care plan is designed by the therapist along with the child’s doctor and family. Because family participation is critical, Total Rehab also provides ongoing home therapy programs. Based on your child’s needs, these programs are added to the rehab services your child already receives at one of our outpatient rehab centers or at school or daycare.</p>\n\t\t<a href=\"/services-and-conditions/pediatric-rehabilitation\">Learn more about pediatric rehabilitation.</a>",

A new, advanced robotic technology is now available to help get patients up and walking again.</p>\n\t\t<p>The EksoNR™ is the first ever FDA approved, wearable robotic exoskeleton for stroke and spinal cord rehabilitation. With early and repetitive use, patients are getting up sooner after their injury, beginning to take steps sooner, and initiating gate faster.</p>\n\t\t<p>ProMedica is the first in Northern Ohio to add this advanced technology to its comprehensive rehabilitation program. It adds another tool to what therapists can use to get their patient mobilized early.</p>\n\t\t<h3>How It Works</h3>\n\t\t<p>The EksoNR™ is designed with custom software that allows clinicians to amplify a patients’ natural ability to activate muscles and produce movement. Real-time software adjustments can be made for customized patient rehabilitation sessions. Torso support with the EksoNR™ helps to correct posture and hip width can be adjusted during sessions. Ankles are supported and kept stable. Patients report feeling secure as they re-learn correct step patterns, weight shifting and work on their posture.</p>\n\t\t<p>Learn more through our outpatient services at <a href=\"tel:+8774255734\">877-425-5734</a>.</p>\n\t\t<h3>What It Means to Patients</h3>\n\t\t<p>With use of the EksoNR™, patients gain not only mobility quicker, but confidence and independence as well. The device improves: &nbsp;</p>\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t<li>Functional Balance</li>\n\t\t<li>Walking Distance</li>\n\t\t<li>Gait Speed</li>\n\t\t</ul>\n\t\t<h3>How a Patient Gets Referred</h3>\n\t\t<p>Patients referred to therapy receive a comprehensive assessment during their evaluation. The therapist will select the exoskeleton&nbsp;device as a treatment intervention for pre-gait and gain activities when indicated. This intervention becomes part of the patient’s treatment plan.</p>\n\t\t<p>Call ProMedica Total Rehab at <a href=\"tel:+4198241390\">877-425-5734</a> to schedule a consultation.</p>\n\n\t",

The disease affects people of all races, but most commonly people who are Black, Hispanic, or of Middle Eastern, Mediterranean and Indian backgrounds.</p>\n\t\t<p>Sickle cell disease causes red blood cells to change from being round and flexible to stiff, sticky and sickle-shaped. These cells can’t travel through blood vessels well and break down quickly.</p>\n\t\t<p>The most common problems associated with sickle cell disease include anemia and blockage of the flow of blood in the tissues. It can cause swelling, pain and other complications. Over time, because of sickling of the red blood cells, patients can also develop chronic organ damage to almost any organ.

Understand how to prevent this disease.</p>\n\t\t<h3>What is skin cancer?</h3>\n\t\t<p>Skin cancer is a specific form of cancer that develops most often on skin exposed to the sun. The three main skin cancer types are:</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"module standard-list\">\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t<li><strong>Basal cell carcinoma.</strong> The most common cancer form. Found in the deepest part of your skin’s outermost layer.</li>\n\t\t<li><strong>Squamous cell carcinoma.</strong> Develops in the flat, outer skin cells.</li>\n\t\t<li><strong>Melanoma.</strong> A malignant tumor that forms in the melanin-forming cells. Often appears as dark brown or black “moles” on your skin.</li>\n\t\t</ul>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t<h3>What skin cancer signs should you look for?</h3>\n\t\t<p>It’s important to check yourself and have a dermatologist check your skin regularly. Examine not only skin that’s regularly exposed to the sun on your face, arms, lips, and scalp, but also places rarely exposed like the bottoms of your feet, stomach, and palms of your hands. Common signs for each skin cancer type vary.</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"module standard-list\">\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t<li><strong>Basal cell carcinoma</strong> often appears as:\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t<li>A fleshy colored, flat lesion.</li>\n\t\t<li>A small, white, shiny bump.</li>\n\t\t</ul>\n\t\t</li>\n\t\t<li><strong>Squamous cell carcinoma</strong> often appears as:\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t<li>A flat, crusty lesion.</li>\n\t\t<li>A raised, hard, red bump.</li>\n\t\t</ul>\n\t\t</li>\n\t\t<li><strong>Melanoma</strong> often appears as:\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t<li>A mole that changes shape, color, texture, or starts to bleed.</li>\n\t\t<li>A large, brownish, speckled spot.</li>\n\t\t<li>A small irregular spot that appears blue, black, red, or white around the edges.</li>\n\t\t<li>Dark lesions in your mouth, lining of your vagina or anus, or on the palms of your hands, bottoms of your feet, fingertips, or toes.</li>\n\t\t</ul>\n\t\t</li>\n\t\t</ul>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t<h3>What can you do to prevent it?</h3>\n\t\t<p>Skin cancer prevention is within your control. Follow these simple steps to reduce your risk:</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"module standard-list\">\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t<li>Wear sunscreen all year long.</li>\n\t\t<li>Avoid the sun at high points of the day.</li>\n\t\t<li>Don’t use tanning beds.</li>\n\t\t<li>Wear protective clothing.</li>\n\t\t<li>Men and women, especially over age 18, should always request a skin exam during regular health check-ups.</li>\n\t\t<li>See your dermatologist regularly for thorough skins checks, early detection, and treatment.</li>\n\t\t</ul>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t<h3>What type of doctor treats skin cancer?</h3>\n\t\t<p>Most skin cancers can be removed in-office by your dermatologist. However, if your skin cancer is more advanced, you may require a cancer treatment team that could include surgical oncologists, medical oncologists, or radiation oncologists.</p>\n\t",

It happens when blood can no longer reach the brain, which can cause brain cells to die.</p>\n\t\t<p>When it comes to stroke care, every second counts. The faster you can get medical attention, the better your chances of lowering the long-term effects or preventing death. That’s why it’s important to understand the signs of a stroke. The easiest way to remember is watch for the signs to BE FAST:</p>\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t<li>B – Balance trouble and dizziness.</li>\n\t\t<li>E – Eyes (blurry or double vision).</li>\n\t\t<li>F – Face drooping or numbing (a person’s smile may look uneven).</li>\n\t\t<li>A – Arm weakness (a person can’t hold their arms up).</li>\n\t\t<li>S – Speech difficulty or trouble repeating a simple sentence.</li>\n\t\t<li>T – Time to call 911.</li>\n\t\t</ul>\n\t\t<p>Call 911 right away if you spot any of the BE FAST symptoms. Also, try to remember what time the symptoms started. It’s critical to seek medical attention right away.</p>\n\t\t<p>Other warning signs may include clumsiness, sudden confusion and sudden severe headache.</p>\n\t\t",

There are three types of strokes.</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"panel-group\" id=\"accordion\" role=\"tablist\" aria-multiselectable=\"true\">\n\t\t<div class=\"panel panel-default\">\n\t\t<div class=\"panel-heading\" role=\"tab\" id=\"heading1\">\n\t\t<h3 class=\"panel-title\"><a role=\"button\" class=\"collapsed\" data-toggle=\"collapse\" data-parent=\"#accordion\" href=\"#collapse1\" aria-expanded=\"false\" aria-controls=\"collapse1\">Hemorrhagic stroke (bleeding)</a></h3>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t<div id=\"collapse1\" class=\"panel-collapse collapse\" role=\"tabpanel\" aria-labelledby=\"heading1\">\n\t\t<div class=\"panel-body\">\n\t\t<p>If you have a hemorrhagic stroke, it means a vessel supplying blood to your brain ruptures and causes bleeding. When an artery bleeds into your brain, oxygen and necessary nutrients can’t reach your brain cells. Brain damage can happen because of the pressure in tissues that surround the brain. About 13% of all strokes are hemorrhagic strokes.</p>\n\t\t<p>There are two types of hemorrhagic strokes:</p>\n\t\t<h4>Intracerebral hemorrhages</h4>\n\t\t<p>This type of hemorrhagic stroke happens when there is bleeding from the blood vessels within your brain. Besides the common risk factors for a stroke, unique risk factors for an intracerebral hemorrhage include:</p>\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t<li><strong> Arteriovenous malformations (AVMs): </strong> Groups of blood vessels in your body that form in the wrong way. This causes arteries and veins to get tangled.</li>\n\t\t<li><strong> Cerebral cavernous malformations (CCM): </strong> Blood vessels that do not form correctly in the brain. For instance, capillaries are tiny blood vessels that group together to form a lesion. A lesion bleeds more easily, and if it bursts and bleeds into the brain, it can cause a stroke.</li>\n\t\t<li><strong> Dural arteriovenous fistulas (DAVF): </strong> Abnormal connections that take place between arteries and veins in the outer membrane of the brain and cause clots. These most often form during a surgery or injury.</li>\n\t\t<li><strong> Hypertension: </strong> Also known as high blood pressure, this is the most common cause of stroke.</li>\n\t\t</ul>\n\t\t<h4>Subarachnoid hemorrhages (SAH)</h4>\n\t\t<p>This type of hemorrhagic stroke happens when there is bleeding in-between the brain and the membranes that cover the brain. Besides the common risk factors for a stroke, unique risk factors for a subarachnoid hemorrhage include:</p>\n\t\t<p><strong> Cerebral aneurysm: </strong> Also known as a brain aneurysm, this is a bulging weakened area in the wall of the blood vessels of the brain. Aneurysms can keep growing in size and weaken the artery wall. If it bursts, uncontrolled bleeding may happen.</p>\n\t\t<p>Warning signs of hemorrhagic stroke include a sudden, severe headache (often described as the worst headache of your life), confusion and being unresponsive.</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t<div class=\"panel panel-default\">\n\t\t<div class=\"panel-heading\" role=\"tab\" id=\"heading2\">\n\t\t<h3 class=\"panel-title\"><a class=\"collapsed\" role=\"button\" data-toggle=\"collapse\" data-parent=\"#accordion\" href=\"#collapse2\" aria-expanded=\"false\" aria-controls=\"collapse2\">Ischemic stroke (clots)</a></h3>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t<div id=\"collapse2\" class=\"panel-collapse collapse\" role=\"tabpanel\" aria-labelledby=\"heading2\">\n\t\t<div class=\"panel-body\">\n\t\t<p>An ischemic stroke happens when a blood vessel that supplies blood to your brain becomes blocked or clogged. When blood flow is lowered, oxygen and needed nutrients can’t get to your brain. Brain cells and tissues begin to die within minutes. About 87% of all strokes are hemorrhagic ischemic strokes.</p>\n\t\t<p>There are two main types of ischemic strokes.</p>\n\t\t<h4>Thrombotic strokes</h4>\n\t\t<p>Thrombotic strokes are caused by a blood clot (thrombus) formed in the arteries that supply blood to your brain. When a thrombotic stroke occurs in the tiny, deep blood vessels in the brain, it’s called a lacunar stroke. These are most common in people who have diabetes or hypertension.</p>\n\t\t<p>Besides the common risk factors for a stroke, unique risk factors for a thrombotic stroke include:</p>\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t<li><strong> Age: </strong> Typically in older adults.</li>\n\t\t<li><strong> Atherosclerosis: </strong> A buildup of fat and lipids inside blood vessel walls.</li>\n\t\t<li><strong> Family history and stroke. </strong></li>\n\t\t<li><strong> High cholesterol. </strong></li>\n\t\t</ul>\n\t\t<p>Warning signs of a thrombotic stroke are unique. They can happen while you’re sleeping or slowly over several hours or days. You could also have one or more mini strokes.</p>\n\t\t<h4>Embolic Strokes</h4>\n\t\t<p>Embolic strokes start when plaque builds up or a blood clot forms in a vessel outside of your head. An embolic stroke happens when this clot travels through your bloodstream and reaches the blood vessels in your brain.</p>\n\t\t<p>Besides the common risk factors for a stroke, unique risk factors for an embolic stroke include:</p>\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t<li>Having AFib.</li>\n\t\t<li>Having heart disease.</li>\n\t\t<li>Undergoing heart surgery.</li>\n\t\t<li>Having carotid stenosis.</li>\n\t\t<li>Having heart failure.</li>\n\t\t<li>Having cardiomyopathy.</li>\n\t\t</ul>\n\t\t<p>Signs of an embolic stroke can happen fast or without any warning signs at all.</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t<div class=\"panel panel-default\">\n\t\t<div class=\"panel-heading\" role=\"tab\" id=\"heading3\">\n\t\t<h3 class=\"panel-title\"><a class=\"collapsed\" role=\"button\" data-toggle=\"collapse\" data-parent=\"#accordion\" href=\"#collapse3\" aria-expanded=\"false\" aria-controls=\"collapse3\">Transient ischemic attack (TIA)</a></h3>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t<div id=\"collapse3\" class=\"panel-collapse collapse\" role=\"tabpanel\" aria-labelledby=\"heading3\">\n\t\t<div class=\"panel-body\">\n\t\t<p>Transient ischemic attacks (TIAs) are sometimes referred to as warning strokes or mini strokes. Unlike a stroke, TIAs don’t cause permanent brain damage. TIA symptoms last less than 24 hours, and often less than one hour. About a third of people who have a TIA will likely suffer a stroke in the next 12 months.</p>\n\t\t<p>With a TIA, an artery is briefly blocked and blood can’t reach a part of your brain. TIA symptoms vary based on the part of the brain that’s affected.</p>\n\t\t<p>Besides the common risk factors for a stroke, unique risk factors for an embolic stroke include carotid artery stenosis. The carotid arteries are the main blood vessels that carry blood and oxygen to your brain. These arteries can become narrowed by fat and lipid buildup, which lowers the oxygen flow to your brain. Blood can’t reach your brain if your carotid arteries are too narrow.</p>\n\t\t<p>TIA symptoms appear to be the same as a stroke, so it’s often hard to tell which type of attack you’re having.</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t",

Common structural heart disease conditions include, but aren’t limited to:</p>\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t<li>Aortic coarctation.</li>\n\t\t<li>Aortic dilatation or aneurysm.</li>\n\t\t<li>Aortic valve stenosis.</li>\n\t\t<li>Atrial septal defect (ASD).</li>\n\t\t<li>Hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy.</li>\n\t\t<li>Left atrial occlusion.</li>\n\t\t<li>Mitral regurgitation (both degenerative and functional mitral regurgitation).</li>\n\t\t<li>Mitral stenosis.</li>\n\t\t<li>Paravalvular leaks.</li>\n\t\t<li>Patent foramen ovale (PFO).</li>\n\t\t</ul>\n\t\t<div class=\"panel-group\" id=\"accordion\" role=\"tablist\" aria-multiselectable=\"true\">\n\t\t<div class=\"panel panel-default\">\n\t\t<div class=\"panel-heading\" role=\"tab\" id=\"heading1\">\n\t\t<h3 class=\"panel-title\"><a role=\"button\" data-toggle=\"collapse\" data-parent=\"#accordion\" href=\"#collapse1\" aria-expanded=\"false\" aria-controls=\"collapse1\">Know the Risk Factors</a></h3>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t<div id=\"collapse1\" class=\"panel-collapse collapse in\" role=\"tabpanel\" aria-labelledby=\"heading1\">\n\t\t<div class=\"panel-body\">\n\t\t<p>Most types of structural heart disease can’t be prevented since it’s something you’re likely born with. However, you could be at increased risk for developing structural heart disease due to:</p>\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t<li><strong>Age:</strong> As you get older, you become more prone to heart conditions.</li>\n\t\t<li><strong>Family history:</strong> Structural heart disease can run in families, and genetic factors can raise your risk.</li>\n\t\t<li><strong>Previous heart issues:</strong> High blood pressure, rheumatic fever, atherosclerosis, ischemic heart disease, an earlier heart attack or congestive heart failure can damage the heart.</li>\n\t\t<li>If your structural heart disease is the result of other cardiac problems, managing your existing health conditions can help prevent more damage to your heart.</li>\n\t\t</ul>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t<div class=\"panel panel-default\">\n\t\t<div class=\"panel-heading\" role=\"tab\" id=\"heading2\">\n\t\t<h3 class=\"panel-title\"><a class=\"collapsed\" role=\"button\" data-toggle=\"collapse\" data-parent=\"#accordion\" href=\"#collapse2\" aria-expanded=\"false\" aria-controls=\"collapse2\">Find Fast, Accurate Diagnosis</a></h3>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t<div id=\"collapse2\" class=\"panel-collapse collapse\" role=\"tabpanel\" aria-labelledby=\"heading2\">\n\t\t<div class=\"panel-body\">\n\t\t<p>Structural heart disease can be difficult to detect in adults, especially since most adult patients don’t seem to experience symptoms. If you do have symptoms, they would likely feel like:</p>\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t<li>Chest tightness.</li>\n\t\t<li>Dizziness.</li>\n\t\t<li>Fatigue.</li>\n\t\t<li>Heart palpitations or flutters, skipping beats or racing heart beats.</li>\n\t\t<li>Trouble with exercise or day-to-day activities.</li>\n\t\t</ul>\n\t\t<h4>Diagnostic Tests</h4>\n\t\t<p>If you’re experiencing any of the symptoms of structural heart disease, your doctor may recommend a series of tests, including:</p>\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t<li>A physical exam.</li>\n\t\t<li>An echocardiogram or ultrasound.</li>\n\t\t<li>A cardiac catheter of the heart.</li>\n\t\t<li>CT scan.</li>\n\t\t<li>MRI.</li>\n\t\t</ul>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t<div class=\"panel panel-default\">\n\t\t<div class=\"panel-heading\" role=\"tab\" id=\"heading3\">\n\t\t<h3 class=\"panel-title\"><a class=\"collapsed\" role=\"button\" data-toggle=\"collapse\" data-parent=\"#accordion\" href=\"#collapse3\" aria-expanded=\"false\" aria-controls=\"collapse3\">Get Effective Treatment</a></h3>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t<div id=\"collapse3\" class=\"panel-collapse collapse\" role=\"tabpanel\" aria-labelledby=\"heading3\">\n\t\t<div class=\"panel-body\">\n\t\t<p>At ProMedica, we offer a full range of minimally invasive techniques to treat your structural heart condition. These procedures include:</p>\n\t\t<h4>Mitral Valve Clip</h4>\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t<li>A minimally invasive procedure in which a clip is placed on your heart’s mitral valve to treat mitral regurgitation (a backflow of blood caused when the mitral valve doesn’t close tightly). For patients who aren’t able to have open-heart surgery, this treatment can be performed instead.</li>\n\t\t</ul>\n\t\t<h4>Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement (TAVR)</h4>\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t<li>A minimally invasive procedure that uses a catheter to replace a diseased aortic valve.</li>\n\t\t</ul>\n\t\t<h4>WATCHMAN™</h4>\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t<li>A device implanted into the heart to lower the risk of stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation (AFib). The procedure is minimally invasive and performed with a catheter, so it doesn’t involve open-heart surgery. The WATCHMANTM can be used instead of taking blood thinners. It permanently blocks off the specific area of the heart where AFib causes most blood clots to form.</li>\n\t\t</ul>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t",

Our surgery options include:</p>\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t<li><strong>Bilobectomy:</strong> Removes two of the lobes in the right lung.</li>\n\t\t<li><strong>Decortication:</strong> Removes the outer surface (or membrane) of the lung. This allows the lung to expand completely.</li>\n\t\t<li><strong>Empyema:</strong> Treats an infection in the lung.</li>\n\t\t<li><strong>Lobectomy:</strong> Removes one of the lobes of the lungs.</li>\n\t\t<li><strong>Lung biopsy:</strong> Removes a tissue sample from the lungs to be tested for lung disease, cancer or another condition.</li>\n\t\t<li><strong>Pericardial window:</strong> Drains fluid from the pericardial sac that surrounds the heart.</li>\n\t\t<li><strong>Pneumonectomy:</strong> Surgery to remove the lung.</li>\n\t\t<li><strong>Pneumothorax:</strong> Treats a collapsed lung.</li>\n\t\t<li><strong>Robotic thoracic surgery:</strong> Offers all the benefits of robot-assisted surgery.

Here are some important ones:</p>\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t<li><strong>You’ll feel better:</strong> Tobacco use delays healing. By quitting tobacco, you’ll recover more quickly from cuts, incisions, wounds and broken bones. You’ll soon find you have more energy and are able to breathe easier, too. The time will come when you’ll no longer have urges to smoke, which leaves you free to focus on what’s important in your life.</li>\n\t\t<li><strong>You’ll protect yourself from disease:</strong> The health risks of tobacco use include various cancers, asthma, emphysema, heart disease, stroke and diabetes. Pregnant women who smoke have a higher risk of premature delivery, low birth-weight babies, stillbirth and sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS).</li>\n\t\t</ul>\n\t\t<div class=\"panel-group\" id=\"accordion\" role=\"tablist\" aria-multiselectable=\"true\">\n\t\t<div class=\"panel panel-default\">\n\t\t<div class=\"panel-heading\" role=\"tab\" id=\"heading1\">\n\t\t<h3 class=\"panel-title\"><a role=\"button\" data-toggle=\"collapse\" data-parent=\"#accordion\" href=\"#collapse1\" aria-expanded=\"false\" aria-controls=\"collapse1\">Steps to Becoming Tobacco Free</a></h3>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t<div id=\"collapse1\" class=\"panel-collapse collapse in\" role=\"tabpanel\" aria-labelledby=\"heading1\">\n\t\t<div class=\"panel-body\">\n\t\t<p>Quitting smoking is a big undertaking. That’s why we advise taking it step-by-step.</p>\n\t\t<p>Your personal smoking cessation plan will help you cope with the physical and emotional issues that may come with your decision to stop smoking. These issues include nicotine withdrawal and strong urges to smoke. We’re here to help you prepare for those challenges and stay the course on your journey to becoming tobacco free.</p>\n\t\t<p>The first step is to think through what that journey will look like for you.</p>\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t<li><strong>Mentally prepare to quit:</strong> Think about your past attempts to quit. Consider what worked and what didn’t, and open your mind to new ideas.</li>\n\t\t<li><strong>Form healthier habits:</strong> Go for a brisk walk or join a gym.</li>\n\t\t<li><strong>Reward yourself:</strong> You’ll save money if you stop smoking. As you’re on your way to becoming tobacco free, reward yourself with small things or experiences that reinforce your progress.</li>\n\t\t<li><strong>Create a support system:</strong> Get help from family and friends; get group, individual or telephone counseling; or join a support group.</li>\n\t\t<li><strong>Stay away from temptation:</strong> Set a no-smoking policy in your home and car, be careful around other tobacco users and avoid alcohol until you’re more comfortable with not smoking.</li>\n\t\t<li><strong>Do your homework and get help from experts:</strong> Ask your doctor about medicines to help you quit. Also consider counseling, which doubles your chances of quitting for good.</li>\n\t\t<li><strong>Set a quit date:</strong> Remember that your plan and medicines take time to work. Set a date two to four weeks in the future to help you plan and prepare.</li>\n\t\t<li><strong>Make a plan, work your plan:</strong> Decide what kind of counseling you want. Talk to your doctor about medicines that can help you quit. Create an emergency plan to help keep you on track. Tweak and adjust your plan as needed.</li>\n\t\t<li><strong>Don’t give up:</strong> Remember that every attempt to quit brings you closer to quitting for good. Never quit trying to quit.</li>\n\t\t</ul>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t<div class=\"panel panel-default\">\n\t\t<div class=\"panel-heading\" role=\"tab\" id=\"heading2\">\n\t\t<h3 class=\"panel-title\"><a class=\"collapsed\" role=\"button\" data-toggle=\"collapse\" data-parent=\"#accordion\" href=\"#collapse2\" aria-expanded=\"false\" aria-controls=\"collapse2\">Find Community Support for Quitting Smoking</a></h3>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t<div id=\"collapse2\" class=\"panel-collapse collapse\" role=\"tabpanel\" aria-labelledby=\"heading2\">\n\t\t<div class=\"panel-body\">\n\t\t<p>You can get more information and resources for quitting tobacco from the following community and public organizations:</p>\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t<li><a href=\"https://ohio.quitlogix.org/en-US/\">Ohio Quit Line</a> (call <a href=\"tel:1-800-784-8669\">1-800-QUIT-NOW</a>)</li>\n\t\t<li>American Cancer Society</li>\n\t\t<li><a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/quit_smoking/index.htm\">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)</a></li>\n\t\t<li><a href=\"https://www.heart.org/en/healthy-living/healthy-lifestyle/quit-smoking-tobacco\">American Heart Association</a></li>\n\t\t</ul>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t<div class=\"panel panel-default\">\n\t\t<div class=\"panel-heading\" role=\"tab\" id=\"heading3\">\n\t\t<h3 class=\"panel-title\"><a class=\"collapsed\" role=\"button\" data-toggle=\"collapse\" data-parent=\"#accordion\" href=\"#collapse3\" aria-expanded=\"false\" aria-controls=\"collapse3\">Staying Tobacco and Nicotine Free for Life</a></h3>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t<div id=\"collapse3\" class=\"panel-collapse collapse\" role=\"tabpanel\" aria-labelledby=\"heading2\">\n\t\t<div class=\"panel-body\">\n\t\t<div class=\"row\">\n\t\t<div class=\"col-xs-12 col-sm-6\">\n\t\t<div class=\"video-cta\">\n\t\t<div class=\"video-cta-title h4\">How to Stay Tobacco and Nicotine Free for Life</div>\n\t\t<div class=\"video-cta-thumb\"><a data-toggle=\"modal\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-video=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/WvpNcE7DQMM\"> <i class=\"icon icon-play-circle-o\"></i> <img src=\"http://i3.ytimg.com/vi/WvpNcE7DQMM/maxresdefault.jpg\" alt=\"How to Stay Tobacco and Nicotine Free\"></a></div>\n\t\t<div class=\"video-cta-description\">A slip is a normal part of learning how to remain nicotine free for life.

      "conditions": "<a name=\"conditions\"></a>\n\t\t<h2 class=\"alt\">Understanding Your Condition</h2>\n\t\t<p>Urinary incontinence, or the loss of bladder control, is a common problem. Sometimes it starts with leaking urine when you cough or sneeze. Then it may progress to sudden, sharp urges to urinate that are so strong you can’t get to the bathroom in time.</p>\n\t\t<p>There are several different types of incontinence, including:</p>\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t<li><strong> Functional incontinence:</strong> You have urine control but can’t get to a restroom in time, usually due to a mental or physical condition. For example, if you have arthritis, it’s hard to unbutton your pants quickly.</li>\n\t\t<li><strong> Mixed incontinence:</strong> You experience more than one type of incontinence.</li>\n\t\t<li><strong> Overflow incontinence:</strong> You leak small amounts of urine when your bladder is overfilled and you feel like you can’t empty your bladder.</li>\n\t\t<li><strong> Stress incontinence:</strong> You lose urine while coughing, sneezing, laughing, walking, running or lifting heavy objects. You may also be moving in other ways that put pressure on your bladder.</li>\n\t\t<li><strong> Urge incontinence:</strong> You have frequent, uncontrollable urges to urinate and often can’t get to a restroom in time. Also known as overactive bladder, urge incontinence is common in people who have conditions such as diabetes, stroke, dementia, Parkinson’s disease and multiple sclerosis.</li>\n\t\t</ul>\n\t\t<p>Most people assume bladder control issues come with aging. But bladders don’t shrink over time, and problems can happen at any age. Some common causes of urinary incontinence are:</p>\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t<li>Childbirth.</li>\n\t\t<li>Enlarged prostate. In men, stress incontinence or urge incontinence can be associated with untreated prostate cancer. But more often, incontinence is a side effect of prostate cancer treatments.</li>\n\t\t<li>Menopause.</li>\n\t\t<li>Obesity.</li>\n\t\t<li>Poor nutrition.</li>\n\t\t<li>Pregnancies.</li>\n\t\t<li>Weakening muscles that control the bladder valve.</li>\n\t\t</ul>\n\t\t",

They can happen anywhere on the body but are most common in the legs. Although they're deeper under the skin than spider veins, they appear as bulging veins raised above the skin.</p>\n\t\t<p>While not life threatening, varicose veins can make you feel self-conscious. They can also lead to more serious vein diseases and cause vein pain, such as:</p>\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t<li>A venous stasis ulcer, which forms when there isn’t proper drainage in the enlarged vein.</li>\n\t\t<li>Phlebitis, an inflammation of the vein.</li>\n\t\t<li>Thrombosis, a blood clot that forms in an enlarged vein.</li>\n\t\t</ul>\n\t\t<h4>Knowing Your Risk Factors</h4>\n\t\t<p>While some risk factors are out of your control, there are some steps you can take to prevent the development of varicose veins. Knowing which risk factors apply to you can go a long way in helping you prevent or manage the condition. Risk factors for varicose veins include:</p>\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t<li>Age.</li>\n\t\t<li>Being overweight.</li>\n\t\t<li>Being a woman.</li>\n\t\t<li>Not being physically active.</li>\n\t\t<li>Genes.</li>\n\t\t<li>Pregnancy.</li>\n\t\t<li>Smoking.</li>\n\t\t<li>Taking oral contraceptives or hormone replacement.</li>\n\t\t</ul>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t<div class=\"panel panel-default\">\n\t\t<div class=\"panel-heading\" role=\"tab\" id=\"heading2\">\n\t\t<h3 class=\"panel-title\"><a class=\"collapsed\" role=\"button\" data-toggle=\"collapse\" data-parent=\"#accordion\" href=\"#collapse2\" aria-expanded=\"false\" aria-controls=\"collapse2\">How to Prevent Varicose Veins</a></h3>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t<div id=\"collapse2\" class=\"panel-collapse collapse\" role=\"tabpanel\" aria-labelledby=\"heading2\">\n\t\t<div class=\"panel-body\">\n\t\t<p>Maintaining a healthy weight and exercising regularly can help stop varicose veins from forming.

Your vascular specialist will work with you to decide which treatments best fit your condition and your lifestyle.</p>\n\t\t<h4>Non-Surgical Treatments</h4>\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t<li><strong>Compression stockings:</strong> elastic stockings that squeeze your veins and prevent blood from pooling. They’re proven to work when worn daily.</li>\n\t\t</ul>\n\t\t<h4>Minimally Invasive Options</h4>\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t<li><strong>Sclerotherapy:</strong> the most common treatment for spider and varicose veins. A concentrated saline solution is injected into the veins and then hardens. This causes the veins to close and collapse. Over time, healthy blood vessels will absorb the blood flow.</li>\n\t\t<li><strong>Endovenous laser ablation:</strong> removes veins using high-intensity laser beams or intense pulsating light that’s guided by an ultrasound.</li>\n\t\t<li><strong>Phlebectomy:</strong> removes your veins using tiny punctures or incisions (cuts) along the path of the vein. Your surgeon then uses a phlebectomy hook (similar to a tiny crochet hook) to remove your veins through these small incisions.</li>\n\t\t<li><strong>Radiofrequency closure ablations:</strong> a treatment that can be used instead of vein stripping. A thin catheter is inserted into the vein through a small opening using a single needle stick. The catheter delivers radio frequency energy to the vein, which causes it to heat, collapse and seal shut. Over time, other healthy veins will take over.</li>\n\t\t<li><strong>VenaSeal™ closure system:</strong> a new, minimally invasive procedure that uses an advanced medical adhesive to close the diseased vein. VenaSeal™ is designed to minimize patient discomfort and recovery time. It offers many benefits to the patient including no need for anesthesia or compression stockings after the procedure.</li>\n\t\t<li><strong>Clarivein®:</strong> a cathether based treatment that uses a rotating tip to disperse medicine and close damaged veins.</li>\n\t\t<li><strong>Varithena®:</strong> a cathether based treatment that injects foam into the diseased vein causing it to close or collapse.</li>\n\t\t</ul>\n\t\t<h4>Surgical Options</h4>\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t<li><strong>Vein stripping:</strong> an incision is made in your skin to remove or tie off the blood vessel.</li>\n\t\t</ul>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t",

That body system includes the blood vessels outside of your heart, which carry blood to parts of your body like your brain, abdomen and extremities.</p>\n\t\t<h3>Who performs vascular lab tests?</h3>\n\t\t<p>Our highly dedicated, well-trained and credentialed vascular technologists will do all that they can to make you feel comfortable during your visit to our vascular lab. We are very proud of our vascular testing accreditation through the Intersocietal Accreditation Commission. It’s one more way to show you how we ensure excellent, quality testing for you.</p>\n\t\t<p>Also good to know: The tests, including vascular ultrasounds, in our labs are non-invasive. That means there’s no need to insert an instrument or device through your skin or into your body. There is also no exposure to radiation because we use sound waves.&nbsp;</p>\n\t\t<p>Once completed, all of our studies are reviewed by one of our board-certified vascular physicians.</p>\n\t\t<p>Jobst Vascular Laboratory is also an education site for local vascular ultrasound training programs including: Owens Community College and Jackson College.</p>\n\t\t<p class=\"pro-callout pro-callout--purple\">Call us today at <a rel=\"tel\" href=\"tel:+18003956278\">1-800-39-JOBST (56278)</a> to schedule an appointment.</p>\n\t\t<h3>What kinds of vascular studies are offered?</h3>\n\t\t<p>Jobst Vascular Laboratory is a full-service laboratory that provides many different types of state-of-the-art diagnostic tests. But vascular ultrasound is the most important tool in our lab and the one we use the most.</p>\n\t\t<p>A duplex vascular ultrasound uses sound waves to take pictures of your vessels and a Doppler to listen to blood flow through your arteries and veins. The exam is painless and easy for you. But it provides invaluable information for your physician.</p>\n\t\t<p>Studies performed in our vascular lab include:</p>\n\t\t<ul class=\"standard-list module\">\n\t\t<li>Cerebrovascular studies of the blood flow to the brain: Carotid artery duplex, transcranial artery Doppler (TCD)</li>\n\t\t<li>Venous: <a href=\"/services-and-conditions/deep-vein-thrombosis\">DVT (deep venous thrombosis)</a>, CVI (chronic venous insufficiency)</li>\n\t\t<li>Arterial studies to determine the amount of blood flow in your arms and legs: ankle-brachial Index (ABI), pulse volume recording (PVR), segmental pressures, duplex scan graft surveillance</li>\n\t\t<li>Abdominal studies to check the blood flow in the arteries and veins in the abdominal cavity: <a href=\"/services-and-conditions/ultrasound\">ultrasound </a>of the inferior vena cava, aorta, kidney and visceral arteries</li>\n\t\t</ul>\n\t\t<h3>Where are your labs located?</h3>\n\t\t<p>We have several vascular labs in convenient ProMedica locations across northwest Ohio and southeast Michigan.Each of these locations provides vascular ultraound services.</p>\n\n\t",

    "content": {
      "articleContent": "\n\t\t<h2>What Is a Vasectomy?</h2>\n\t\t<p>A vasectomy is a permanent and effective form of birth control for men. During the procedure, your vas deferens, the tube that carries sperm from your testes, is cut and sealed. This blocks sperm from reaching semen so that, when ejaculated, it cannot get a woman pregnant.</p>\n\t\t<p>The procedure typically takes 20-30 minutes and is safe with few side effects. Usually within a couple of days, you’re feeling better and back to your normal routine.</p>\n\t\t<p class=\"pro-callout pro-callout--purple\">Call <a href=\"tel:+18448558326\" rel=\"tel\">1-844-855-TEAM</a> for a consultation.</p>\n\t\t<h3>Types of Vasectomies</h3>\n\t\t<p>Two most common types include:</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"module standard-list\">\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t<li><strong>Conventional vasectomy.</strong> During this more traditional method, small cuts are made on each side of the scrotum to reach the vas deferens, which are cut, tied or fastened with a metal clip.</li>\n\t\t<li><strong>No scalpel vasectomy.</strong> This newer, more modern method is done through one tiny hole in the skin. A tool is used to gently stretch the skin opening so that the vas deferens can be reached. Because no cuts are made, there is little bleeding. It heals quickly with little or no scarring.</li>\n\t\t</ul>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t<h3>Debunking the Myths about Vasectomy</h3>\n\t\t<p>It’s normal to have questions and concerns about a vasectomy, but sometimes myths about the procedure can lead to unfounded concerns. Here’s the truth about vasectomies. A vasectomy:</p>\n\t\t<ul class=\"standard-list module\">\n\t\t<li><strong>Won’t affect your sexual performance. </strong>A vasectomy won’t affect your sex drive or your&nbsp;masculinity in any way other than preventing you from fathering a child. Men have even reported higher sexual satisfaction after a vasectomy.</li>\n\t\t<li><strong>Is safe for your sexual organs. </strong> There's very little risk that your testicles, penis or other parts of your reproductive system will be injured during surgery.</li>\n\t\t<li><strong>Doesn't increase your risk of certain cancers</strong>Although there have been some concerns about a possible link between having a vasectomy and getting testicular or prostate cancer in the past, there's no proven link.</li>\n\t\t<li><strong>Doesn’t increase your risk of heart disease. </strong> As with cancer fears, there doesn't appear to be any link between vasectomy and heart problems.</li>\n\t\t<li><strong>Causes minor, not severe, pain.</strong> You might feel minor pain and pulling or tugging during surgery, but severe pain is rare. Likewise, after surgery you might have some pain, but for most men the pain is minor and goes away after a few days.</li>\n\t\t</ul>\n\t\t<h2 id=\"faqaccordion\">ProMedica Vasectomy FAQs</h2>\n\t\t<div class=\"panel-group\" role=\"tablist\" aria-multiselectable=\"true\">\n\t\t<div class=\"panel panel-default\">\n\t\t<div class=\"panel-heading\" role=\"tab\" id=\"heading1\">\n\t\t<h3 class=\"panel-title\"><a class=\"collapsed\" role=\"button\" data-toggle=\"collapse\" data-parent=\"#accordion\" href=\"#faq1\" aria-expanded=\"false\" aria-controls=\"faq1\">Is a vasectomy right for me?</a></h3>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t<div id=\"faq1\" class=\"panel-collapse collapse\" role=\"tabpanel\" aria-labelledby=\"heading1\" aria-expanded=\"false\">\n\t\t<div class=\"panel-body\">\n\t\t<p>Choosing a vasectomy as a form of birth control is a major decision. You should be 100% sure that it is the right decision for you before undergoing this procedure. You and your partner should talk about the decision to not have any more children. Having a vasectomy may be a good choice if:</p>\n\t\t<ul class=\"standard-list module\">\n\t\t<li>You are an adult male and you are either done having children or don’t want to have children.</li>\n\t\t<li>You are in a stable relationship and both partners agree to permanent birth control.</li>\n\t\t<li>Pregnancy would be a health risk for your partner.</li>\n\t\t<li>You or your partner has a genetic disorder that you don’t want to pass on to a child.</li>\n\t\t</ul>\n\t\t<p>To learn more about a vasectomy and ask questions to determine if it is right for you, schedule a consultation with one of our board-certified urologists.</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t<div class=\"panel panel-default\">\n\t\t<div class=\"panel-heading\" role=\"tab\" id=\"heading6\">\n\t\t<h3 class=\"panel-title\"><a class=\"collapsed\" role=\"button\" data-toggle=\"collapse\" data-parent=\"#accordion\" href=\"#faq6\" aria-expanded=\"false\" aria-controls=\"faq6\">How do I prepare for a vasectomy?</a></h3>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t<div id=\"faq6\" class=\"panel-collapse collapse\" role=\"tabpanel\" aria-labelledby=\"heading6\" aria-expanded=\"false\">\n\t\t<div class=\"panel-body\">\n\t\t<p>It is important that you share your medical history with the doctor; include information about drugs (both prescription and over-the-counter), as well as supplements, you are taking. Be sure to tell your doctor about any drug allergies or bleeding conditions you have.</p>\n\t\t<p>Your physician will tell you about any specific things you need to do (and know) to get ready for your procedure.

Your vasectomy will most often be done under local anesthesia, but sedation is available for those who need it. The area will be numbed, but typically you will be awake. It takes about 20 - 30 minutes to complete the procedure.</p>\n\t\t<p>Generally, here’s what happens during a vasectomy:</p>\n\t\t<ul class=\"standard-list module\">\n\t\t<li>You will be asked to remove any jewelry or other objects that might get in the way during the procedure.</li>\n\t\t<li>You will remove your clothing and put on a hospital gown.</li>\n\t\t<li>You will be asked to empty your bladder.</li>\n\t\t<li>You will lie on your back on an exam table.</li>\n\t\t<li>Your scrotum may be shaved and cleaned with an antiseptic solution or special soap.</li>\n\t\t<li>The surgeon will inject a numbing medicine into your scrotum.</li>\n\t\t<li>The doctor will make either a small cut or opening on one side of your scrotum to find the vas deferens, which will be cut, tied or fastened with a metal clip. The site is closed and a bandage applied. The procedure is repeated on the other side of the scrotum to block the second vas deferens.</li>\n\t\t<li>In many cases, both vas deferens can be reached through the same hole.</li>\n\t\t<li>In some cases, small stitches or skin glue may be used to close the cuts.</li>\n\t\t</ul>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t<div class=\"panel panel-default\">\n\t\t<div class=\"panel-heading\" role=\"tab\" id=\"heading8\">\n\t\t<h3 class=\"panel-title\"><a class=\"collapsed\" role=\"button\" data-toggle=\"collapse\" data-parent=\"#accordion\" href=\"#faq8\" aria-expanded=\"false\" aria-controls=\"faq8\">What happens after a vasectomy?</a></h3>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t<div id=\"faq8\" class=\"panel-collapse collapse\" role=\"tabpanel\" aria-labelledby=\"heading8\" aria-expanded=\"false\">\n\t\t<div class=\"panel-body\">\n\t\t<p>You will likely be able to go home soon after surgery. The staff will watch you closely and the doctor may give you pain medication. You may be told to use an ice pack for the first day to reduce pain and swelling. Here is what you may expect during recovery:</p>\n\t\t<ul class=\"standard-list module\">\n\t\t<li>Rest at home the day after surgery. Don't do any strenuous activity. Avoid standing or walking too long.</li>\n\t\t<li>Depending on the type of work you do, you may be able to go back in 1 to 3 days.</li>\n\t\t<li>You should be able to return to most activities in a week, but avoid heavy lifting and hard exercise for up to 1 to 3 weeks.</li>\n\t\t<li>You may need to wear a jock strap for a few days.</li>\n\t\t<li>You should not bathe or swim until 1 to 2 days after your vasectomy.</li>\n\t\t<li>You may be able to return to sexual activity in about a week, but you should continue to use another form of birth control until the doctor tests the semen to be sure there are no sperm left. This test is often performed about two months after surgery. It is important to know that vasectomies will occasionally fail and checking semen samples afterwards to confirm sterility is strongly recommended.</li>\n\t\t</ul>\n\t\t<p>Vasectomy is very safe, but all surgeries carry some risks. Tell your doctor if you have any of the following:</p>\n\t\t<ul class=\"standard-list module\">\n\t\t<li>A lump in your scrotum</li>\n\t\t<li>Any drainage, bleeding, redness, or swelling</li>\n\t\t<li>Fever</li>\n\t\t<li>Chills</li>\n\t\t<li>Increasing pain or pain that is not eased by medicine</li>\n\t\t<li>Trouble passing urine</li>\n\t\t<li>Bleeding disorders</li>\n\t\t</ul>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t<div class=\"panel panel-default\">\n\t\t<div class=\"panel-heading\" role=\"tab\" id=\"heading9\">\n\t\t<h3 class=\"panel-title\"><a class=\"collapsed\" role=\"button\" data-toggle=\"collapse\" data-parent=\"#accordion\" href=\"#faq9\" aria-expanded=\"false\" aria-controls=\"faq9\">Can I have my vasectomy reversed?</a></h3>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t<div id=\"faq9\" class=\"panel-collapse collapse\" role=\"tabpanel\" aria-labelledby=\"heading9\" aria-expanded=\"false\">\n\t\t<div class=\"panel-body\">\n\t\t<p>Possibly. Some vasectomies may be reversed, but the process can be more difficult than the actual vasectomy, isn’t always successful and can be expensive.

They can happen anywhere on the body but are most common in the legs. Although they're deeper under the skin than spider veins, they appear as bulging veins raised above the skin.</p>\n\t\t<p>While not life threatening, varicose veins can make you feel self-conscious. They can also lead to more serious vein diseases and cause vein pain, such as:</p>\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t<li>A venous stasis ulcer, which forms when there isn’t proper drainage in the enlarged vein.</li>\n\t\t<li>Phlebitis, an inflammation of the vein.</li>\n\t\t<li>Thrombosis, a blood clot that forms in an enlarged vein.</li>\n\t\t</ul>\n\t\t<h4>Knowing Your Risk Factors</h4>\n\t\t<p>While some risk factors are out of your control, there are some steps you can take to prevent the development of varicose veins. Knowing which risk factors apply to you can go a long way in helping you prevent or manage the condition. Risk factors for varicose veins include:</p>\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t<li>Age.</li>\n\t\t<li>Being overweight.</li>\n\t\t<li>Being a woman.</li>\n\t\t<li>Not being physically active.</li>\n\t\t<li>Genes.</li>\n\t\t<li>Pregnancy.</li>\n\t\t<li>Smoking.</li>\n\t\t<li>Taking oral contraceptives or hormone replacement.</li>\n\t\t</ul>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t<div class=\"panel panel-default\">\n\t\t<div class=\"panel-heading\" role=\"tab\" id=\"heading2\">\n\t\t<h3 class=\"panel-title\"><a class=\"collapsed\" role=\"button\" data-toggle=\"collapse\" data-parent=\"#accordion\" href=\"#collapse2\" aria-expanded=\"false\" aria-controls=\"collapse2\">How to Prevent Varicose Veins</a></h3>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t<div id=\"collapse2\" class=\"panel-collapse collapse\" role=\"tabpanel\" aria-labelledby=\"heading2\">\n\t\t<div class=\"panel-body\">\n\t\t<p>Maintaining a healthy weight and exercising regularly can help stop varicose veins from forming.

They often look like a sunburst or “spider web,” are red or blue in color and are often found on the face and legs.</p>\n\t\t<p>At this time, no one knows what causes spider veins.

Your vascular specialist will work with you to decide which treatments best fit your condition and your lifestyle.</p>\n\t\t<h4>Non-Surgical Treatments</h4>\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t<li><strong>Compression stockings:</strong> elastic stockings that squeeze your veins and prevent blood from pooling. They’re proven to work when worn daily.</li>\n\t\t</ul>\n\t\t<h4>Minimally Invasive Options</h4>\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t<li><strong>Sclerotherapy:</strong> the most common treatment for spider and varicose veins. A concentrated saline solution is injected into the veins and then hardens. This causes the veins to close and collapse. Over time, healthy blood vessels will absorb the blood flow.</li>\n\t\t<li><strong>Endovenous laser ablation:</strong> removes veins using high-intensity laser beams or intense pulsating light that’s guided by an ultrasound.</li>\n\t\t<li><strong>Phlebectomy:</strong> removes your veins using tiny punctures or incisions (cuts) along the path of the vein. Your surgeon then uses a phlebectomy hook (similar to a tiny crochet hook) to remove your veins through these small incisions.</li>\n\t\t<li><strong>Radiofrequency closure ablations:</strong> a treatment that can be used instead of vein stripping. A thin catheter is inserted into the vein through a small opening using a single needle stick. The catheter delivers radio frequency energy to the vein, which causes it to heat, collapse and seal shut. Over time, other healthy veins will take over.</li>\n\t\t<li><strong>VenaSeal™ closure system:</strong> a new, minimally invasive procedure that uses an advanced medical adhesive to close the diseased vein. VenaSeal™ is designed to minimize patient discomfort and recovery time. It offers many benefits to the patient including no need for anesthesia or compression stockings after the procedure.</li>\n\t\t<li><strong>Clarivein®:</strong> a cathether based treatment that uses a rotating tip to disperse medicine and close damaged veins.</li>\n\t\t<li><strong>Varithena®:</strong> a cathether based treatment that injects foam into the diseased vein causing it to close or collapse.</li>\n\t\t</ul>\n\t\t<h4>Surgical Options</h4>\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t<li><strong>Vein stripping:</strong> an incision is made in your skin to remove or tie off the blood vessel.</li>\n\t\t</ul>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t",

Try to drink at least six to eight glasses of water, milk, juice or other fluids every day and limit alcohol and caffeinated beverages. Oral medications can be taken with a full glass of water.</p>\n\t\t<h4>Proteins</h4>\n\t\t<p>Protein is the building block for new cells and wound repair. It prevents muscle loss. Without enough protein, your body will pull protein from muscle tissue, making you weaker. Eat at least one serving of high protein food, like meat and dairy products, for every meal and snack. Adding protein powder or liquid to food or beverages is another great way to get enough protein.</p>\n\t\t<h4>Vitamins and Minerals</h4>\n\t\t<p>Your skin needs vitamins and minerals to heal. A diet rich in vitamin C, vitamin E and magnesium is important for the healing process. Your doctor may prescribe a daily vitamin and mineral supplement.</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t",

X-ray— using radiation passing through the body to produce an image on a special film —was discovered in 1885, and is considered a milestone in the development of modern medicine. For the first time, physicians were able to see inside the body to detect injury and disease, often in its early stages when the illness or injury is most treatable.</p>\n\t\t<h3>What to Expect During an X-ray</h3>\n\t\t<p>During an x-ray, a machine is used to send x-rays through your body. Radiation is absorbed by the more dense parts of your body, which produces a lighter image on the x-ray picture called a radiograph. The less dense areas of the body (soft tissue) absorb less radiation and appear darker on the x-ray.</p>\n\t\t<p>Common x-ray studies used to detect disease and injury include:</p>\n\t\t<ul class=\"module standard-list\">\n\t\t<li>Chest Exam - used to diagnose diseases of the heart and lungs</li>\n\t\t<li>Bone Studies - used to determine the relationship between bones and visualize fractures</li>\n\t\t<li>Digestive System Studies - used to detect diseases such as ulcers and tumors.</li>\n\t\t<li>Searching for Foreign Bodies - used to locate objects in the body that should not be there</li>\n\t\t<li>Intravenous Pyelogram (IVP) - Used to study the kidneys and ureters to the bladder.</li>\n\t\t</ul>\n\t",
