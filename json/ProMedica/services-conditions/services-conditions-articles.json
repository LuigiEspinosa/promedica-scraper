It’s your body’s main supplier of blood, and a rupture to it can cause life-threatening bleeding.</p>\n\t\t<p>This rupture commonly happens when the aorta’s thick wall is weakened or damaged. It forms a bulge or a balloon, called an aneurysm. Though an aneurysm can occur in any blood vessel, they occur most often in the abdominal (stomach) portion of the aorta. This is called an abdominal aortic aneurysm.</p>\n\t\t<p class=\"pro-callout pro-callout--purple\">Call us today at <a rel=\"tel\" href=\"tel:+18003956278\">1-800-39-JOBST (56278)</a> to schedule an appointment.</p>\n\t\t<h3>What are the symptoms of an abdominal aortic aneurysm?</h3>\n\t\t<p>Though three out of four people show no symptoms, some people feel stomach or low back pain.</p>\n\t\t<h3>Who’s at risk for an abdominal aortic aneurysm?</h3>\n\t\t<ul class=\"standard-list module\">\n\t\t<li>Men over the age&nbsp;of 60 have the highest occurrence.</li>\n\t\t<li>Family history increases your risk.</li>\n\t\t<li>Chances increase if you have <a href=\"/services-and-conditions/high-blood-pressure-hypertension\"><span>high blood pressure.</span></a></li>\n\t\t<li>Risk gets higher if you smoke.</li>\n\t\t<li>Chances increase with age.</li>\n\t\t</ul>\n\t\t<h3>What are my options if I have an abdominal aortic aneurysm?</h3>\n\t\t<p>Your vascular surgeon will recommend specific tests and treatment based on the size of the aneurysm and how fast it’s growing.

This procedure involves injecting a contrast material (x-ray dye) into a blood vessel to make it visible on an x-ray. The dye is placed directly in the artery through a very small flexible tube called a catheter, which is inserted in to the artery through a small nick in the skin.</p>\n\t\t<p>The procedure is often used to detect abnormalities of the blood vessels, such as narrowing and blockage caused by fatty deposits or blood clots, and aneurysms (defined as weakening or ballooning of the wall of the artery). Angiography can also detect abnormal patterns of blood vessels caused by tumors and can show sites of internal bleeding. Demonstrating these blood vessel abnormalities can help the physician determine the extent of the disease and determine the best treatment option.</p>\n\n\t",

      "articleContent": "\t\t<h2>Understanding ADHD</h2>\n\t\t<p>Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common childhood developmental disorders.</p>\n\t\t<p>Typically symptoms start developing before age 7. Children with ADHD may appear overly hyper, compulsive, active or unable to focus. These symptoms create significant challenges in at least two areas of their day-to-day life – home, social settings, school, activities or work (for adults).</p>\n\t\t<p>Remember that everyone matures differently. Behaviors shouldn’t cause concern unless they are more severe or frequent than in other children the same age. Additional factors – personality, temperament, energy or other health conditions – are sometimes mistaken for ADHD. Because of this, careful diagnosis is crucial. The evaluation process typically includes several tests performed by a <a href=\"/find-locations/location-results?LocationText=behavioral%20health\">behavioral health</a> professional.</p>\n\t\t<p>What are the common ADHD symptoms? Signs are grouped into three areas:</p>\n\t\t<h3>Inattention</h3>\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t<li>Easily distracted</li>\n\t\t<li>Does not appear to listen</li>\n\t\t<li>Avoids or dislikes tasks requiring sustained mental effort</li>\n\t\t<li>Struggles to follow through on instructions – especially multiple steps</li>\n\t\t<li>Frequently forgets or misplaces belongings</li>\n\t\t</ul>\n\t\t<h3>Hyperactivity</h3>\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t<li>Has difficulty doing quiet activities</li>\n\t\t<li>Excessively fidgets or talks; squirmy</li>\n\t\t<li>Has difficulty remaining seated</li>\n\t\t<li>Acts as if driven by a motor</li>\n\t\t</ul>\n\t\t<h3>Impulsivity</h3>\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t<li>Blurts out answers before questions have been completed</li>\n\t\t<li>Frequently makes unnecessary mistakes or take risks</li>\n\t\t<li>Interrupts others</li>\n\t\t<li>Has difficulty waiting or taking turns</li>\n\t\t</ul>\n\t\t<hr>\n\t\t<p>What should you do if your think your child has ADHD? Contact your pediatrician to discuss. If further assessment is needed, your pediatrician may recommend evaluation by a licensed behavioral health professional.</p>\n\n\t",

      "articleContent": "\n\t\t<h2>Understanding Bipolar Disorder</h2>\n\t\t<p>Bipolar disorder is a mental disorder that causes identifiable and sometimes intense changes in mood and energy level. Someone with bipolar disorder may experience periods of high energy (manic periods) followed by periods of depression or lethargy (depressive periods). The exact cause is unknown, but research suggests that it is hereditary, as it often runs in families. Studies are still underway to try and identify which gene (or genes) may be responsible.</p>\n\t\t<h3>Signs of Bipolar Disorder</h3>\n\t\t<p>Someone with bipolar disorder will experience both types of the following symptoms to a varying degree:</p>\n\t\t<h4>Manic symptoms:</h4>\n\t\t<ul class=\"module standard-list\">\n\t\t<li>Has an overly inflated sense of self-esteem</li>\n\t\t<li>Seems to not need sleep or rest as much</li>\n\t\t<li>Is very distracted and irritable</li>\n\t\t<li>Excessively gets involved in high-risk and/or pleasurable activities, for example: sexual promiscuity, reckless driving, reckless spending, substance abuse</li>\n\t\t<li>Enhanced talkativeness</li>\n\t\t<li>Appears to have excessive “high” or euphoric feelings, grandiose at times</li>\n\t\t<li>Unpredictably changes mood from happy or silly, anger or agitation</li>\n\t\t<li>Increased sex drive</li>\n\t\t<li>Increased energy level</li>\n\t\t<li>Uses uncharacteristic poor judgment</li>\n\t\t</ul>\n\t\t<h4>Depressive symptoms:</h4>\n\t\t<ul class=\"module standard-list\">\n\t\t<li>Difficulty with relationships</li>\n\t\t<li>Expresses excessive guilt</li>\n\t\t<li>Expresses hopelessness</li>\n\t\t<li>Is extremely sensitive to failure or rejection</li>\n\t\t<li>Is unable to concentrate</li>\n\t\t<li>Lacks energy</li>\n\t\t<li>Lacks interest in activities once enjoyed</li>\n\t\t<li>Persistently suffers sadness</li>\n\t\t<li>Seems irritable, hostile or aggressive</li>\n\t\t<li>Shares feelings of wanting to die</li>\n\t\t<li>Shows changes in appetite or weight</li>\n\t\t<li>Shows signs of low self-esteem</li>\n\t\t<li>Sleeps too much or very little</li>\n\t\t<li>Thinks about suicide or attempts suicide</li>\n\t\t</ul>\n\t\t<p>If you think you may have bipolar disorder, talk to your primary care doctor. After ruling out other conditions through a physical exam, they can help you find a psychiatrist, psychologist or other behavioral health specialist with experience in treating bipolar disorder.</p>\n\t\t<h3>Bipolar Disorder in Children and Adolescents</h3>\n\t\t<p>Bipolar disorder is a condition with alternating sets of symptoms. During certain periods of time, your child or adolescent may act extremely happy, elated, or very irritable (manic symptoms). During the alternate periods of time they will exhibit symptoms of <a href=\"/services-and-conditions/depression\">major depression.</a></p>\n\t\t<p>When symptoms are present before age 12, they are sometimes confused with <a href=\"/services-and-conditions/attention-defecit-hyperactivity-disorder-adhd\">attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)</a>. However, advances continue to be made in recognizing bipolar disorder in younger children.</p>\n\t\t<p>If you believe your child has bipolar disorder, contact your pediatrician or family doctor to set up an appointment for evaluation. If further assessment is needed, your doctor may recommend evaluation by a licensed behavioral health professional. Bipolar disorder can be effectively treated, usually with a combination of therapy and medication.</p>\n\t",

If you’re diagnosed with this disease, it means a fatty deposit (plaque) has built up in one or both of the carotid arteries and this plaque is restricting blood flow to your brain. Pieces of this plaque can break off and briefly block the artery, causing a transient ischemic attack (TIA) or “mini stroke,” or break off and completely block the artery, causing a stroke.</p>\n\t",

What is chemotherapy? It’s the use of medications to treat cancer. Depending on the cancer type and its stage, chemotherapy is used to treat cancer, keep it from spreading, slow its cell growth, or to relieve its symptoms.</p>\n\t\t<p>Chemotherapy, commonly referred to as chemo, destroys cancer cells and stops them from growing or multiplying. Chemotherapy can be used along with radiation therapy, surgery, or both.</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"panel-group\" role=\"tablist\" aria-multiselectable=\"true\">\n\t\t<div class=\"panel panel-default\">\n\t\t<div class=\"panel-heading\" role=\"tab\" id=\"heading1\">\n\t\t<h3 class=\"panel-title\"><a class=\"collapsed\" role=\"button\" data-toggle=\"collapse\" data-parent=\"#accordion\" href=\"#faq1\" aria-expanded=\"false\" aria-controls=\"faq1\">How is chemotherapy given?</a></h3>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t<div id=\"faq1\" class=\"panel-collapse collapse\" role=\"tabpanel\" aria-labelledby=\"heading1\" aria-expanded=\"false\">\n\t\t<div class=\"panel-body\">\n\t\t<p>You may be treated in your doctor’s office, a clinic in the hospital, or at home.

These permanent catheters are called “central venous catheters” and are placed under your skin’s surface. Chemotherapy, blood, and IV fluids can be given through this catheter, and blood for lab tests can be drawn from this site.</p>\n\t\t<p>An implantable port can also be used to deliver chemotherapy. It’s round in shape and is usually surgically inserted under your skin surface on the chest wall between your neck and shoulder. To use the port, the nurse will insert a needle through your skin surface to access it.</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t<div class=\"panel panel-default\">\n\t\t<div class=\"panel-heading\" role=\"tab\" id=\"heading2\">\n\t\t<h3 class=\"panel-title\"><a class=\"collapsed\" role=\"button\" data-toggle=\"collapse\" data-parent=\"#accordion\" href=\"#faq2\" aria-expanded=\"false\" aria-controls=\"faq2\">How long does chemotherapy treatment last?</a></h3>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t<div id=\"faq2\" class=\"panel-collapse collapse\" role=\"tabpanel\" aria-labelledby=\"heading2\" aria-expanded=\"false\">\n\t\t<div class=\"panel-body\">\n\t\t<p>Your dosage schedule is individualized to your treatment plan.

Chromosomes (small “groups” of genes) in the body determine how a baby grows and functions after birth. Minor changes in these genes can greatly affect body and brain development.</p>\n\t\t<h3>Down Syndrome</h3>\n\t\t<p>Down syndrome affects about 1 out of every 700 babies born. The condition occurs when a baby develops in the womb with one extra copy of chromosome 21.</p>\n\t\t<p>Down syndrome is normally tested for during pregnancy, or right after birth, to allow parents time to prepare for a baby requiring special needs.</p>\n\t\t<p>While people with Down syndrome share similar physical traits, each individual has different abilities. They typically experience intellectual and physical challenges, but can reach full and productive lives with the support of speech, occupational and physical therapy.</p>\n\t\t<h3>Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS)</h3>\n\t\t<p>FAS can occur when a pregnant mother drinks alcohol, passing it through the umbilical cord to their baby.</p>\n\t\t<p>Alcohol exposure can prevent a baby from developing properly in the womb. There is no measure for a “safe” amount of alcohol to drink during pregnancy. Zero consumption is recommended.</p>\n\t\t<p>Children born with FAS may have abnormal facial features, experience stunted growth and central nervous system problems. In addition, many people experience trouble with learning, speech, sight, and hearing throughout their lives.</p>\n\t\t<p>There is no cure for FAS, but early treatment and ongoing support can help a child reach their full potential.</p>\n\t\t<p>Treatment factors:</p>\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t<li>Early diagnosis (before age 6)</li>\n\t\t<li>Stable home environment</li>\n\t\t<li>Absence of violence</li>\n\t\t<li>Special education and social services</li>\n\t\t</ul>\n\t\t<p class=\"pro-callout pro-callout--purple\">Our multidisciplinary team of physicians and behavioral health specialists can help your child reach their individual potential.</p>\n\t",

During this time, the CT machine takes various X-rays that your radiologist will interpret. At a later appointment, your doctor will discuss with you your results.</p>\n\t\t<p><strong>Why is a CT important to my health?</strong> CT gives your doctor valuable insight into your body, how it’s functioning, and what treatments may result.

If you have depression, it consistently affects your mood, thoughts and body.</p>\n\t\t<h3>Symptoms of Depression</h3>\n\t\t<p>You may notice several of the following signs during the same two-week period:</p>\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t<li>Difficulty with relationships</li>\n\t\t<li>Excessive guilt</li>\n\t\t<li>Hopelessness</li>\n\t\t<li>Extremely sensitive to failure or rejection</li>\n\t\t<li>Unable to concentrate</li>\n\t\t<li>Lack energy</li>\n\t\t<li>Lack interest in activities once enjoyed</li>\n\t\t<li>Persistent sadness</li>\n\t\t<li>Irritability, hostility, or aggression</li>\n\t\t<li>Feeling of wanting to die</li>\n\t\t<li>Changes in appetite or weight</li>\n\t\t<li>Low self-esteem</li>\n\t\t<li>Sleeping too much or very little</li>\n\t\t<li>Thinking about suicide or attempting suicide</li>\n\t\t</ul>\n\t\t<p class=\"pro-callout pro-callout--purple\">In most cases, treatment is necessary for recovery. Begin a conversation about your depression with your primary care physician, or look for a behavioral health specialist such as a counselor or psychiatrist.</p>\n\t\t<h3>Depression in Children and Adolescents</h3>\n\t\t<p>According to the National Institute of Mental Health, the onset of major depression is occurring much earlier in life than it used to. And the earlier the condition onsets, the higher the probability that it will continue into adulthood.</p>\n\t\t<p>If your adolescent has major depression, they are unable to merely “snap out of it” and feel better on their own.</p>\n\t\t<p>What should you do if your think your child has major depression? Contact your pediatrician or family doctor immediately to discuss. Early diagnosis of depression is important because it often coexists with another psychiatric disorder, such as substance abuse or anxiety disorder. If your doctor feels your child needs further assessment, they may recommend evaluation by a licensed behavioral health professional. Major depression can be effectively treated.</p>\n\t",

It functions much like a standard <a href=\"/services-and-conditions/x-ray\">X-ray</a>, but differs in that a radioactive material is injected into your body. This material settles into your bones for a short time and allows your doctor to detect bone disease much earlier than when using typical X-ray.</p>\n\t\t<p>It’s a comfortable procedure that takes about three to four hours, which includes time for the injected material to settle and for the actual scan (X-ray).</p>\n\t\t<h3>Why is a bone scan important to your health?</h3>\n\t\t<p>A bone scan is an important tool to quickly detect the source of various symptoms you may have experienced like bone pain or swelling. Early detection is essential to prevent fractures or the spread of disease or infection through your bones. You and your doctor can discuss the most effective treatments based on your bone scan results.</p>\n\n\t",

Changes in the blood vessels of the retina, the light sensitive layer of tissue at the back of the inner eye, can lead to this condition. In some people, retinal blood vessels may swell and leak fluid. In others, abnormal new blood vessels grow on the surface of the retina. These changes may result in vision loss or blindness.</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t<div class=\"panel panel-default\">\n\t\t<div class=\"panel-heading\" role=\"tab\" id=\"heading2\">\n\t\t<h3 class=\"panel-title\"><a class=\"collapsed\" role=\"button\" data-toggle=\"collapse\" data-parent=\"#accordion\" href=\"#faq2\" aria-expanded=\"false\" aria-controls=\"faq2\">Who is at risk for diabetic retinopathy?</a></h3>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t<div id=\"faq2\" class=\"panel-collapse collapse\" role=\"tabpanel\" aria-labelledby=\"heading2\" aria-expanded=\"false\">\n\t\t<div class=\"panel-body\">\n\t\t<p>Anyone with diabetes is at risk for diabetic retinopathy. The longer you have diabetes, the more likely you are to develop diabetic retinopathy. Your risk rises if you have diabetes and you smoke, have high blood pressure, or are pregnant.</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t<div class=\"panel panel-default\">\n\t\t<div class=\"panel-heading\" role=\"tab\" id=\"heading6\">\n\t\t<h3 class=\"panel-title\"><a class=\"collapsed\" role=\"button\" data-toggle=\"collapse\" data-parent=\"#accordion\" href=\"#faq6\" aria-expanded=\"false\" aria-controls=\"faq6\">What are the symptoms of diabetic retinopathy?</a></h3>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t<div id=\"faq6\" class=\"panel-collapse collapse\" role=\"tabpanel\" aria-labelledby=\"heading6\" aria-expanded=\"false\">\n\t\t<div class=\"panel-body\">\n\t\t<p>In the early stages of diabetic retinopathy, you may have no symptoms. Vision may not change until the disease gets worse. Then you may have blurry or double vision; dark or floating spots; pain or pressure in one or both eyes; or rings, flashing lights, or blank spots in your vision.</p>\n\t\t<p>A decrease in your central vision could be caused by macular edema which may occur from diabetic retinopathy. It happens when the macula, a part of the retina, swells from the leaking fluid and causes blurred vision. When new vessels grow on the surface of the retina, they can bleed into the eye. This may decrease vision.</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t<div class=\"panel panel-default\">\n\t\t<div class=\"panel-heading\" role=\"tab\" id=\"heading7\">\n\t\t<h3 class=\"panel-title\"><a class=\"collapsed\" role=\"button\" data-toggle=\"collapse\" data-parent=\"#accordion\" href=\"#faq7\" aria-expanded=\"false\" aria-controls=\"faq7\">How is diabetic retinopathy diagnosed?</a></h3>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t<div id=\"faq7\" class=\"panel-collapse collapse\" role=\"tabpanel\" aria-labelledby=\"heading7\" aria-expanded=\"false\">\n\t\t<div class=\"panel-body\">\n\t\t<p>Along with a complete health history and eye exam, your eye care professional may do these tests to diagnose diabetic retinopathy:</p>\n\t\t<ul class=\"standard-list module\">\n\t\t<li>Visual acuity test. This is the common eye chart test that measures vision ability at various distances.</li>\n\t\t<li>Tonometry. This standard test is done to check the pressure (intraocular pressure, or IOP) inside the eye.</li>\n\t\t<li>Pupil dilation. For a close up exam of the eye’s lens and retina, your pupil is widened with eye drops.</li>\n\t\t<li>Ophthalmoscopy. This is a test where a doctor looks very closely at the retina using a special magnifying glass.</li>\n\t\t<li>Fluorescein angiography. In this test, a dye is injected into the bloodstream. The dye helps the blood vessels in the eye show up while pictures are taken with a special camera. This test lets the doctor see if the blood vessels are leaking.</li>\n\t\t<li>Optical coherence tomography. In this test, light waves are used to make detailed images of the retina.</li>\n\t\t</ul>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t<div class=\"panel panel-default\">\n\t\t<div class=\"panel-heading\" role=\"tab\" id=\"heading8\">\n\t\t<h3 class=\"panel-title\"><a class=\"collapsed\" role=\"button\" data-toggle=\"collapse\" data-parent=\"#accordion\" href=\"#faq8\" aria-expanded=\"false\" aria-controls=\"faq8\">How is diabetic retinopathy treated?</a></h3>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t<div id=\"faq8\" class=\"panel-collapse collapse\" role=\"tabpanel\" aria-labelledby=\"heading8\" aria-expanded=\"false\">\n\t\t<div class=\"panel-body\">\n\t\t<p>If you have diabetic retinopathy, your treatment will depend on your age, general health, symptoms and the severity of the condition.</p>\n\t\t<p>Even people with advanced retinopathy have a good chance of keeping their vision if they are treated before the retina becomes severely damaged. Treatment for diabetic retinopathy may include:</p>\n\t\t<ul class=\"standard-list module\">\n\t\t<li>Laser surgery. This involves shrinking the abnormal blood vessels, or sealing the leaking ones.</li>\n\t\t<li>Vitrectomy. Vitrectomy is a procedure that involves removing the cloudy, jelly-like substance (vitreous) that fills the center of the eye. The vitreous is replaced with a saline solution.</li>\n\t\t<li>Injections. Certain medications can be injected into the eye to slow the growth of the abnormal vessels of the retina.</li>\n\t\t</ul>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t<div class=\"panel panel-default\">\n\t\t<div class=\"panel-heading\" role=\"tab\" id=\"heading9\">\n\t\t<h3 class=\"panel-title\"><a class=\"collapsed\" role=\"button\" data-toggle=\"collapse\" data-parent=\"#accordion\" href=\"#faq9\" aria-expanded=\"false\" aria-controls=\"faq9\">Can diabetic retinopathy be prevented? </a></h3>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t<div id=\"faq9\" class=\"panel-collapse collapse\" role=\"tabpanel\" aria-labelledby=\"heading9\" aria-expanded=\"false\">\n\t\t<div class=\"panel-body\">\n\t\t<p>While you can’t completely prevent diabetic retinopathy, you can reduce your risk of getting it. Controlling your blood sugar slows the start of retinopathy and keeps it from getting worse. It also lessens the need for laser surgery for severe retinopathy.</p>\n\t\t<p><strong>You can reduce the risk of developing the condition by:</strong></p>\n\t\t<ul class=\"standard-list module\">\n\t\t<li>Having a dilated eye exam once a year. An eye exam does not prevent retinopathy but it can help diagnose eye problems that can then be treated. An eye exam can also alert you and your healthcare provider if the diabetes needs to be better controlled.</li>\n\t\t<li>Having an eye exam before pregnancy or in the first trimester of your pregnancy. If you’re pregnant and take insulin to manage your diabetes, that can raise the odds that the condition will become worse. Continue to be monitored every trimester and for 1 year after birth depending on how severe the retinopathy is.</li>\n\t\t</ul>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t",

Most tested (or challenged) infants will travel home from the hospital in a properly fitted car seat; however, because some infants are unable to maintain a patent airway in the semi-reclined position of a car seat, they must instead travel home in a recumbent car bed.&nbsp;</p>\n\t\t<p>We meet the needs of high-risk infants at <a href=\"/location/promedica-russell-j-ebeid-childrens-hospital\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"ProMedica Russell J.

Our team of physicians, nurses&nbsp;and respiratory therapists follow your baby’s care.</p>\n\t\t<p>Infants referred to the Infant Monitor Program may be:</p>\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t<li>Babies who experience an apparent life-threatening event (ALTE)</li>\n\t\t<li>SIDS siblings</li>\n\t\t<li>Premature infants with apnea / bradycardia</li>\n\t\t<li>Infants with obstructive apnea</li>\n\t\t<li>Babies with seizure / neurological-related apnea</li>\n\t\t<li>Oxygen dependent infants</li>\n\t\t<li>Infants with cardiac problems</li>\n\t\t</ul>\n\t\t<p>Infants that initially fail the car seat challenge should undergo an additional car seat challenge prior to transitioning to a traditional, semi-reclined car seat. The Infant Monitor Program staff at <a href=\"/location/promedica-toledo-hospital\" title=\"ProMedica Toledo Hospital\">Toledo </a>and Russell J. Ebeid Children's Hospital's&nbsp;will administer follow-up test on infants that failed their initial Car Seat Challenge Testing prior to discharge.&nbsp;</p>\n\t\t<p>Follow-up out-patient testing is done in Harris McIntosh Tower&nbsp;by a Respiratory Therapist or an RN, when the pediatrician feels it is time to re-test.&nbsp; A test will take a minimum&nbsp;of 90 minutes.&nbsp;</p>\n\t\t<p>We can be reached by telephone 24 hours a day to answer questions and solve problems related to infant alarms and/or equipment use</p>\n\t\t<p class=\"pro-callout pro-callout--purple\">Contact the Infant Monitor Program at <a rel=\"tel\" href=\"tel:+14192912229\">419-291-2229</a> or <a rel=\"tel\" href=\"tel:+18008762763\">800-876-2763</a>.</p>\n\n\t",

      "articleContent": "\t\t<h2>About Lymphedema</h2>\n\t\t<p>Lymphedema refers to excessive swelling of one or more extremities following damage to the lymphatic system. The lymphatic system is a complicated system in the body that helps to carry fluid, bacteria and harmful substance through a series of lymph nodes that “clean” the fluid.</p>\n\t\t<p>When lymph nodes are damaged or surgically removed, the system can malfunction and lead to excessive and sometimes uncontrollable swelling in the body. This can often happen as a result of cancer and the treatment associated with it. Lymphedema can be a debilitating disease that has a significant impact on the ability to perform everyday tasks.</p>\n\t\t<hr class=\"divider-green\">\n\t\t<h3>Treating Lymphedema with ProMedica Total Rehab</h3>\n\t\t<h4>How can ProMedica Total Rehab help you?</h4>\n\t\t<p>If you are experiencing any of the symptoms discussed, then lymphedema therapy may be beneficial to you.

It’s important you feel confident in the screening you receive. Talk with your doctor about digital mammography’s enhanced quality and accuracy.</p>\n\t\t<h2 class=\"h2-brand\">How does a digital mammogram work?</h2>\n\t\t<p>As far as your experience, all mammograms are very much alike. You’ll most likely begin regular mammograms between the ages of 35 and 40, younger if there’s a breast cancer history for yourself or your family. Your mammograms are used for both early detection as well as for diagnosis of lumps, breast pain&nbsp;or unusual breast symptoms.</p>\n\t\t<p>During your mammogram, your breast is compressed between two flat surfaces and X-rayed. Digital mammograms display and record the high definition X-ray images on a computer monitor, while a standard film-based mammogram records these images on individual films.</p>\n\t\t<h2 class=\"h2-brand\">What are the benefits of digital mammography?</h2>\n\t\t<p>A few solid benefits for you are:</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"module standard-list\">\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t<li>Less exposure to radiation compared to a standard film-based mammogram.</li>\n\t\t<li>Reduced need for mammogram re-takes means less time spent for you</li>\n\t\t<li>Higher resolution images and image manipulation for accurate detection and diagnosis</li>\n\t\t<li>Your images are stored in computer files for easy access and sharing amongst experts</li>\n\t\t</ul>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t<h2 class=\"h2-brand\">Is a digital mammogram right for you?</h2>\n\t\t<div class=\"module standard-list\">This decision is between you and your doctor, but the common perspective is that digital mammography is better suited for you if you:\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t<li>Are under 50 years old</li>\n\t\t<li>Have dense breasts</li>\n\t\t<li>Haven’t been through menopause or have gone through it within the past year</li>\n\t\t</ul>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t<h2 class=\"h2-brand\">Are digital mammograms available at every ProMedica Radiology location?</h2>\n\t\t<p>We have many convenient locations with this state-of-the-art technique. <a class=\"link-cta\" href=\"/find-locations/location-results?LocationText=digital%20mammography\">Find one near you.</a></p>\n\t\t</div>\n\n\t",

      "articleContent": "\n\t\t<h2>About Multiple Sclerosis</h2>\n\t\t<p>Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a disease in which your immune system attacks myelin, the covering that protects your nerves. This damage to the myelin disrupts information flow both within your brain and between your brain and the rest of your body. These nerves deteriorate, which is an irreversible condition. MS is a degenerative disease, meaning the symptoms will get progressively worse over time.</p>\n\t\t<h3>MS Symptoms</h3>\n\t\t<p>People with multiple sclerosis usually have their first symptoms between the ages of 20 and 40. Signs and symptoms vary depending on the extent of nerve damage and which nerves are affected. Some Multiple Sclerosis symptoms include:</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"module standard-list\">\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t<li>Blurred vision</li>\n\t\t<li>Loss of balance</li>\n\t\t<li>Poor coordination</li>\n\t\t<li>Slurred speech</li>\n\t\t<li>Tremors</li>\n\t\t<li>Numbness</li>\n\t\t<li>Extreme fatigue</li>\n\t\t<li>Problems with memory and concentration</li>\n\t\t<li>Paralysis</li>\n\t\t<li>Blindness</li>\n\t\t</ul>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t<h3>MS Flare-Ups</h3>\n\t\t<p>You can go days or years without major changes in your symptoms and then suddenly experience a “flare up,” or relapse. MS is active again when you develop new MS symptoms, a regular problem gets worse, or your symptoms last 24 hours or longer.</p>\n\t\t<h3>Causes of Multiple Sclerosis</h3>\n\t\t<p>The cause of MS is currently unknown, but childhood infections and genetics are believed to play a role.There’s no cure, but there are ways to control your symptoms. Since prolonged over-exertion and stress may be contributing factors to flare ups, exercise, regular stretching, and relaxation may help you manage MS symptoms. Talk to your primary physician or neurologist, who may recommend treatments such as physical therapy, muscle relaxants, or medications to reduce fatigue or other symptoms.</p>\n\t",

      "articleContent": "\t\t<h2>Understanding Nuclear Medicine</h2>\n\t\t<p>Nuclear medicine is used to determine how an organ is functioning. For example, nuclear medicine can be used to study how a damaged heart is functioning or how blood flow is restricted in parts of the brain. Other organs that can be imaged using nuclear medicine include the liver, kidneys, thyroid, bones, and many others.</p>\n\t\t<p>During a nuclear medicine study, chemicals \"tagged\" with radionuclides that emit gamma rays are injected into the body. The chemicals collect in the area of the body that is to be studied. Images, which may be taken immediately or days after the injection, are obtained by using a gamma camera that detects the gamma rays and produces an image map called a scintigram.</p>\n\t\t<p>Nuclear medicine studies provide information that can help your doctor diagnose and treat diseases in their early stages. Nuclear medicine, using radioactive substances, can also be used to treat certain diseases and conditions, such as overactive thyroid glands or thyroid tumors.</p>\n\t\t<h3>Preparing for a Nuclear Medicine Study</h3>\n\t\t<p>Generally, there are no special preparations that need to be made prior to having a nuclear medicine study. However, certain types of studies may require some preparation. For example, prior to having a thyroid uptake and scan, your doctor may ask that you avoid foods and medications with iodine for one week prior to the test. Your doctor or radiologist can advise you about any special instructions you may need to follow.</p>\n\n\t",

      "articleContent": "\t\t<h2>Understanding Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder</h2>\n\t\t<p>Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a condition where one experiences unreasonable fearful thoughts and performs ritualistic activities in order to manage those thoughts.</p>\n\t\t<p>The frequent disturbing thoughts or images are referred to as <strong>obsessions.</strong> The repetitive rituals performed to try and dispel the obsessions are called <strong>compulsions.</strong> For example: mealtimes, bath, bedtime, and exercise are all positive routine activities. However, OCD rituals are so frequent and intense that they can interfere with your daily life.</p>\n\t\t<hr>\n\t\t<p>The following are examples of <strong>obsessions</strong>:</p>\n\t\t<ul class=\"module standard-list\">\n\t\t<li>Aggressive impulses, thoughts and/or behaviors</li>\n\t\t<li>Counting, thinking about numbers and sequences for long periods of time</li>\n\t\t<li>Excessive fear of something terrible happening</li>\n\t\t<li>Extreme attention to detail</li>\n\t\t<li>Intense preoccupation with dirt and germs</li>\n\t\t<li>Persistent thoughts of performing extremely distasteful sexual acts</li>\n\t\t<li>Preoccupation with perfection, symmetry or order</li>\n\t\t<li>Preoccupation with remembering trivial things</li>\n\t\t<li>Repeated doubts (for example, did I lock the door?)</li>\n\t\t<li>Thoughts about violence towards someone else or their self</li>\n\t\t<li>Thoughts conflicting with religious beliefs</li>\n\t\t</ul>\n\t\t<p>The following are examples of <strong>compulsions</strong>:</p>\n\t\t<ul class=\"module standard-list\">\n\t\t<li>Asking the same question repeatedly</li>\n\t\t<li>Constant checking and rechecking (for example, checking if a door is locked)</li>\n\t\t<li>Excessive counting, recounting and/or grouping</li>\n\t\t<li>Hoarding objects</li>\n\t\t<li>Repeated obscene words or gestures</li>\n\t\t<li>Repeated words, sounds, numbers, and/or music to self</li>\n\t\t<li>Repeated hand-washing (often more than 100 times a day)</li>\n\t\t<li>Repeated words spoken by self or others</li>\n\t\t</ul>\n\t\t<hr>\n\t\t<h3>Causes</h3>\n\t\t<p>The exact cause is unknown, but research suggests that it’s a neurological brain disorder caused by a deficiency of the chemical, serotonin, in the brain. OCD tends to run in families.</p>\n\t\t<h3>OCD in Children and Adolescents</h3>\n\t\t<p>If you believe your child has OCD, contact your pediatrician to set up an appointment for evaluation. If further assessment is needed, your pediatrician may recommend evaluation by a licensed behavioral health professional. OCD can be effectively treated, usually with a combination of individual therapy and medication.</p>\n\n\t",

While it traditionally was considered to affect the motor system, it is now recognized to have a range of clinical features. In addition to movement problems, there may also be neuropsychiatric and non-motor symptoms. The exact cause of Parkinson's disease is not always clear but many symptoms are thought to result from a lack of dopamine (chemical that is responsible for transmitting signals in between the nerve cells (neurons) of the brain).</p>\n\t\t<p><strong>The key motor features of Parkinson's disease are:</strong></p>\n\t\t<ul class=\"standard-list module\">\n\t\t<li>Tremor that typically occurs at rest and may have a \"pill rolling\" appearance</li>\n\t\t<li>Stiffness or rigidity of the limbs and trunk</li>\n\t\t<li>Generalized slowness of movement (bradykinesia)</li>\n\t\t<li>Inability to keep body in stable or balance position</li>\n\t\t<li>Gait difficulty</li>\n\t\t</ul>\n\n\t",

      "articleContent": "\n\t\t<h2>Understanding Pelvic Congestion Syndrome</h2>\n\t\t<p>Chronic <a href=\"/services-and-conditions/pelvic-pain\">pelvic pain</a>, defined as pain lasting six months or more, affects 15% of women in America. Many issues can cause this pain. But, did you know that a vascular problem could be one of them?</p>\n\t\t<p>Pelvic congestion syndrome (PCS) is a condition that causes chronic pelvic pain due to problems with your veins in your lower abdomen. Veins carry blood from all areas of your body back to the heart. However, in some women, the veins in the lower abdomen have weakened, making their veins inefficient at moving the blood back up to their heart. This allows blood to build up or pool, causing pressure and bulging veins resulting in varicose veins in the pelvis.</p>\n\t\t<p>Some sub-types of pelvic congestion syndrome include ovarian vein reflux, nutcracker syndrome, and May-Thurner syndrome.</p>\n\t\t<hr>\n\t\t<div class=\"row\">\n\t\t<div class=\"col-xs-12 col-sm-6\">\n\t\t<h4>New Procedure Offers Speedier Recovery for Patients with Nutcracker Syndrome</h4>\n\t\t<div class=\"responsive-video\"><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/DeVyzgrxO7E?enablejsapi=1\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t<div class=\"row\">\n\t\t<h3>Who is at risk for pelvic congestion syndrome?</h3>\n\t\t<p>PCS mostly effects women of childbearing age. It is also common in women who have had two or more pregnancies and those who have a family history of venous disease.</p>\n\t\t<h3>What are the symptoms of pelvic congestion syndrome?</h3>\n\t\t<p>The main symptom of pelvic congestion syndrome is pelvic pain that lasts at least six months. Often, the pain starts during or after a pregnancy. Many women describe the pain as a severe, dull ache that worsens around the time of their menstrual period. Others describe the pain as heavy or sharp.</p>\n\t\t<p><strong>Other symptoms include:</strong></p>\n\t\t<ul class=\"standard-list module\">\n\t\t<li>Pain before or during a heavy menstrual flow</li>\n\t\t<li>Frequent urge to urinate</li>\n\t\t<li>Varicose veins on the external genitals, thighs and/or hemorrhoids</li>\n\t\t</ul>\n\t\t<p><strong>Activities that can worsen the pain include:</strong></p>\n\t\t<ul class=\"standard-list module\">\n\t\t<li>Changing your posture</li>\n\t\t<li>Having sexual intercourse (pain can occur both during and after)</li>\n\t\t<li>Standing or sitting for long periods of time</li>\n\t\t<li>Traveling on long automobile trips or flights</li>\n\t\t<li>Walking</li>\n\t\t</ul>\n\t\t<h3>How is pelvic congestion syndrome diagnosed?</h3>\n\t\t<p>Pelvic pain is not easy to diagnose. Your primary care provider (PCP) or gynecologist will need to consider the many possible causes of pelvic pain, including problems with your reproductive, urinary or gastrointestinal systems. To diagnose, your doctor will typically obtain a complete medical history, perform an abdominal and pelvic exam, Pap smear, and order blood work.</p>\n\t\t<p>After ruling out other pelvic problems, a vascular expert like the ones at <a href=\"/services-and-conditions/vascular-care/vascular-institute\">Jobst Vascular Institute</a> may be consulted. This specialist may recommend additional testing such as:</p>\n\t\t<ul class=\"standard-list module\">\n\t\t<li><a href=\"/services-and-conditions/ultrasound\">Ultrasound </a>– A Doppler ultrasound to check the blood flow in the pelvic blood vessels.</li>\n\t\t<li><a href=\"/services-and-conditions/computed-tomography-ct-scan\">Computed tomography (CT)</a> or <a href=\"/services-and-conditions/magnetic-resonance-imaging-mri\">magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) </a>– Imaging that provides more detailed pictures of your pelvic veins.</li>\n\t\t</ul>\n\t\t<h3>What are the next steps?</h3>\n\t\t<p>Once you have been diagnosed with PCS, know that today more treatments than ever are available. Your gynecologist may prescribe hormone medications to relieve pain. Your gynecologist may also recommend that you talk with a Jobst vascular surgeon for additional treatment options. Most of these treatments are minimally invasive and can be performed in an outpatient setting.</p>\n\t\t<p class=\"pro-callout pro-callout--purple\">To learn more about treatment options, call Jobst Vascular Institute Vein Care at <a rel=\"tel\" href=\"tel:4192912090\">877-551-VEIN (419-291-2090)</a>.</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t",

The initial evaluation typically includes:</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"module standard-list\">\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t<li>Checking the motor control, strength, and endurance of core support muscles</li>\n\t\t<li>Assessing your pelvic floor muscle coordination for different activities and positions</li>\n\t\t<li>Other testing, as needed.</li>\n\t\t</ul>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t<p>Based on the findings of this exam, the physical therapist creates a unique treatment plan to help you improve your pelvic floor function. The treatment plan may include working with you on behavioral approaches such as bladder re-training techniques. Plus, an individualized physical therapy regimen to help rehab your pelvic floor muscles. The physical therapist may use a variety of techniques.

A variety of techniques are used to treat patients.</li>\n\t\t<li>Evaluation or treatment involving speculums or stirrups—neither is used in pelvic floor physical therapy</li>\n\t\t<li>A “one size fits all” program. Treatment is uniquely designed to your specific needs.</li>\n\t\t</ul>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t<h3>How can pelvic floor physical therapy help me?</h3>\n\t\t<p>The treatments used by our pelvic floor physical therapists are designed to address issues with the structures of the pelvic floor (i.e. nerves, lymphatics, muscles, connective tissue, skin, and bones). Pelvic floor physical therapy exercises and treatments aim to improve:</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"module standard-list\">\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t<li>The leakage of urine or loss of bladder control</li>\n\t\t<li>Painful sex and vaginal pain</li>\n\t\t<li>Sexual dysfunction (male and female)</li>\n\t\t<li>Pelvic pain and discomfort in the vaginal area with or without sexual interactions</li>\n\t\t<li>Pelvic organ prolapse (the dropping of the bladder, rectum or uterus)</li>\n\t\t<li>Constipation or incomplete bowel or bladder emptying</li>\n\t\t<li>Back, hip or sacroiliac joint (SI) pain that has not improved with time or traditional treatment</li>\n\t\t</ul>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t<p class=\"pro-callout pro-callout--purple\">Talk to a specialist; call <a href=\"tel:1-419-824-1968\">419-824-1968</a> to schedule an appointment today.</p>\n\t\t<h3>What should I expect when I visit the pelvic floor physical therapist?</h3>\n\t\t<p>Our certified and well-trained therapists welcome you in a comfortable and friendly environment. We also believe in a team approach to care so that you are in control of your treatment.</p>\n\t\t<p>At your first visit, we’ll do an initial evaluation that lasts about 60 minutes. This evaluation typically includes:</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"module standard-list\">\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t<li>A detailed discussion including an explanation of your medical history and your condition</li>\n\t\t<li>Checking the motor control, strength, and endurance of core support muscles</li>\n\t\t<li>Assessing your pelvic floor muscle coordination for different activities and positions</li>\n\t\t<li>An external and external and internal assessment of your pelvic floor function including strength, coordination, tone, and sensation</li>\n\t\t</ul>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t<p>Based on the findings of this exam, we’ll create a unique treatment plan to help you improve your pelvic floor function.

Plus, an individualized physical therapy regimen to help rehab your pelvic floor muscles. The physical therapist may use a variety of techniques specific to your needs.</p>\n\t\t<hr class=\"divider-green\">\n\t\t<h2>Kegels and More for Your Pelvic Health</h2>\n\t\t<p>Pelvic floor physical therapist may utilize a number of different therapies to treat chronic pelvic pain and pelvic floor disorders, including:</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"module standard-list\">\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t<li>Stretching exercises, massage and other relaxation techniques</li>\n\t\t<li>Kegel exercises: Regular, daily exercise of pelvic muscles can make the pelvic floor muscles stronger and improve, and even prevent, urinary incontinence.</li>\n\t\t<li>Biofeedback: Uses different types of devices to give information on how well pelvic muscles are contracting. The message or “feedback” can help improve awareness and control of pelvic floor muscles. This is often used along with Kegel exercises to help patients gain awareness and control of the pelvic muscles.</li>\n\t\t<li>Vaginal weight training: Small weights are held within the vagina by tightening the vaginal muscles.</li>\n\t\t<li>Pelvic floor electrical stimulation: Mild electrical pulses stimulate muscle contractions. This may be done along with Kegel exercises.</li>\n\t\t</ul>\n\t\t</div>\n\n\t",

Understand what it is, what to expect, and how it might benefit your health.</p>\n\t\t<h3>What is a PET?</h3>\n\t\t<p>Commonly called a PET scan, PET stands for positron emission tomography. It’s commonly requested in order to provide more information about how the following organs and tissues are working:</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"module standard-list\">\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t<li>Brain</li>\n\t\t<li>Heart</li>\n\t\t<li>Lung</li>\n\t\t<li>Breast</li>\n\t\t</ul>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t<h3>How does a PET scan work?</h3>\n\t\t<p>During your PET, you’ll be injected with a small amount of radioactive material, called a tracer. This tracer travels throughout your body and collects in your organs and tissues, giving your radiologist a highlighted view of the area under examination.</p>\n\t\t<p>In order for your radiologist to assess your body’s function, you’ll lie still on a table and pass through a tunnel-like machine. This machine will detect the tracer and transform the signals into the image your radiologist will assess.</p>\n\t\t<h3>Why is a PET scan important to your health?</h3>\n\t\t<p>Generally, a PET gives your doctor a much more complete picture as to the origin or causes of symptoms you might have. Clear information means concise treatment; and focused treatment gives you the best opportunity to improve your health. Also, a PET can have results that indicate that your body is functioning just as it should, therefore ruling out serious conditions.</p>\n\n\t",

      "articleContent": "\t\t<h2>Understanding Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder</h2>\n\t\t<p>Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a condition that occurs after one experiences an emotionally or physically frightening event. The person is so affected by the ordeal that they develop frequent memories or flashbacks of it. When exposed to situations that resemble the traumatic event, they undergo severe emotional, mental and physical distress.</p>\n\t\t<p>PTSD symptoms can start soon following the event and improve shortly after or they may persist long-term.</p>\n\t\t<h3>Common PTSD Symptoms</h3>\n\t\t<p>Signs vary, but you may notice any, or all, of the following:</p>\n\t\t<ul class=\"module standard-list\">\n\t\t<li>Avoiding certain situations or places</li>\n\t\t<li>Depression</li>\n\t\t<li>Difficulty concentrating</li>\n\t\t<li>Experiencing physical discomfort (headaches, stomachaches)</li>\n\t\t<li>Fearing death at an early age</li>\n\t\t<li>Having frequent flashbacks or intrusive memories</li>\n\t\t<li>Irritability</li>\n\t\t<li>Loss of interest in activities you used to enjoy</li>\n\t\t<li>Lost touch with reality</li>\n\t\t<li>Having nightmares</li>\n\t\t<li>Trouble at work or in school</li>\n\t\t</ul>\n\t\t<h3>Events That Trigger PTSD</h3>\n\t\t<p>Specific examples of events which typically cause PTSD:</p>\n\t\t<ul class=\"module standard-list\">\n\t\t<li>Abuse – physical or emotional</li>\n\t\t<li>Animal bites</li>\n\t\t<li>Automobile accidents</li>\n\t\t<li>Experiencing a natural disaster (such as a flood or hurricane)</li>\n\t\t<li>Invasive medical procedures</li>\n\t\t<li>Man-made tragedies (bombings and shootings)</li>\n\t\t<li>Neglect</li>\n\t\t<li>Sexual assault or molestation</li>\n\t\t<li>Violent attacks (mugging, torture, kidnapping, being held captive)</li>\n\t\t</ul>\n\t\t<p>If you believe you may have PTSD, schedule an appointment with a provider who works in behavioral health. Counselors, therapists, psychologists, and psychiatrists are all examples of providers who may be able to help diagnose and treat your PTSD.</p>\n\t\t<h3>PTSD in Children and Adolescents</h3>\n\t\t<p>Children and adolescents can suffer from PTSD. A child with PTSD will exhibit many of the same symptoms that an adult might. In addition to the standard symptoms, children may also begin acting younger than their age (thumb-sucking, wetting the bed). Many times, PTSD started during childhood develops into a chronic disorder. However, PTSD can be treated with therapy.</p>\n\t\t<p class=\"pro-callout pro-callout--purple\">Can PTSD be prevented? As a parent, you may be able to reduce the risk of traumatic experiences in your child.</p>\n\t\t<h4>Preventing PTSD in Children and Adolescents</h4>\n\t\t<ul class=\"module standard-list\">\n\t\t<li>Teach your child to say NO to someone who tries to touch them inappropriately or make them uncomfortable.</li>\n\t\t<li>Offer support and counseling to children who have undergone a traumatic experience.</li>\n\t\tSupport prevention programs within your community and at your child’s school.</ul>\n\t\t<p>If you suspect your child may have PTSD, contact your pediatrician for a proper evaluation. If further assessment is needed, your pediatrician may recommend a comprehensive evaluation by a licensed behavioral health professional.</p>\n\n\t",

A new, advanced robotic technology is now available to help get patients up and walking again.</p>\n\t\t<p>The EksoNR™ is the first ever FDA approved, wearable robotic exoskeleton for stroke and spinal cord rehabilitation. With early and repetitive use, patients are getting up sooner after their injury, beginning to take steps sooner, and initiating gate faster.</p>\n\t\t<p>ProMedica is the first in Northern Ohio to add this advanced technology to its comprehensive rehabilitation program. It adds another tool to what therapists can use to get their patient mobilized early.</p>\n\t\t<h3>How It Works</h3>\n\t\t<p>The EksoNR™ is designed with custom software that allows clinicians to amplify a patients’ natural ability to activate muscles and produce movement. Real-time software adjustments can be made for customized patient rehabilitation sessions. Torso support with the EksoNR™ helps to correct posture and hip width can be adjusted during sessions. Ankles are supported and kept stable. Patients report feeling secure as they re-learn correct step patterns, weight shifting and work on their posture.</p>\n\t\t<p>Learn more through our outpatient services at <a href=\"tel:+8774255734\">877-425-5734</a>.</p>\n\t\t<h3>What It Means to Patients</h3>\n\t\t<p>With use of the EksoNR™, patients gain not only mobility quicker, but confidence and independence as well.

This intervention becomes part of the patient’s treatment plan.</p>\n\t\t<p>Call ProMedica Total Rehab at <a href=\"tel:+4198241390\">877-425-5734</a> to schedule a consultation.</p>\n\n\t",

      "articleContent": "\n\t\t<h2>Using Radiation Therapy to Treat Cancer</h2>\n\t\t<p>Radiation therapy is the use of high-energy X-rays to treat cancer. These are therapeutic X-rays, which are different from diagnostic X-rays. Radiation can be an effective cancer treatment and is designed to prevent cancer cells from growing and multiplying. The goal is to slow or stop tumor growth and, in many cases, completely destroy the tumor.</p>\n\t\t<p>Your radiation therapy treatment is administered in stages. You’re supported by experienced professionals and caregivers along the way.</p>\n\t\t<p><strong>What are the steps to radiation therapy treatment?</strong></p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t<li><strong>Your first visit.</strong>&nbsp;This is a consultation to discuss your cancer and treatment options with your <a href=\"#providers\" title=\"radiation oncologists list\">radiation oncologist</a>. This is a time to ask questions. If possible, bring a family member.</li>\n\t\t<li><strong>Simulation.</strong>&nbsp;Your radiation oncologist uses X-ray equipment called a “simulator” to aid in your treatment plan. Sometimes, a non-toxic dye is injected in order to outline certain organs. Prior to the simulation, your radiation therapist places you into a special positioning device that will hold your body still during treatment.</li>\n\t\t<li><strong>Planning marks.</strong>&nbsp;During your simulation, you’re given either small black permanent marks, about the size of a freckle, or similarly sized semi-permanent marks. These marks create a focal point for the radiation treatment machine so treatment can be given to precisely the same spot each time.</li>\n\t\t<li><strong>Receiving treatments.</strong>&nbsp;A machine called a “linear accelerator” provides your therapeutic radiation dosages. You’ll lie on a table, sometimes shielded by protective blocks, and will be raised under the linear accelerator. The treatment machine will move to a predetermined position and apply the radiation treatment. You won’t feel or see the radiation. Expect weekly assessments while you’re given treatment to see how your body responds.</li>\n\t\t<li><strong>Follow-up care.</strong>&nbsp;It’s extremely important to schedule regular exams after you’ve finished your radiation treatment. This may include blood work and X-rays. Continue to maintain a healthy lifestyle after your treatment is complete.</li>\n\t\t</ul>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t<p><strong>What are the side effects of radiation therapy?</strong>&nbsp;Side effects differ, depending on the treatment area. The most common are fatigue and skin irritation. Your doctor or nurse will discuss ways to prevent or minimize these effects with you, including&nbsp;nutrition for managing fatigue.</p>\n\t",

Understand how to prevent this disease.</p>\n\t\t<h3>What is skin cancer?</h3>\n\t\t<p>Skin cancer is a specific form of cancer that develops most often on skin exposed to the sun. The three main skin cancer types are:</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"module standard-list\">\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t<li><strong>Basal cell carcinoma.</strong> The most common cancer form. Found in the deepest part of your skin’s outermost layer.</li>\n\t\t<li><strong>Squamous cell carcinoma.</strong> Develops in the flat, outer skin cells.</li>\n\t\t<li><strong>Melanoma.</strong> A malignant tumor that forms in the melanin-forming cells. Often appears as dark brown or black “moles” on your skin.</li>\n\t\t</ul>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t<h3>What skin cancer signs should you look for?</h3>\n\t\t<p>It’s important to check yourself and have a dermatologist check your skin regularly. Examine not only skin that’s regularly exposed to the sun on your face, arms, lips, and scalp, but also places rarely exposed like the bottoms of your feet, stomach, and palms of your hands. Common signs for each skin cancer type vary.</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"module standard-list\">\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t<li><strong>Basal cell carcinoma</strong> often appears as:\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t<li>A fleshy colored, flat lesion.</li>\n\t\t<li>A small, white, shiny bump.</li>\n\t\t</ul>\n\t\t</li>\n\t\t<li><strong>Squamous cell carcinoma</strong> often appears as:\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t<li>A flat, crusty lesion.</li>\n\t\t<li>A raised, hard, red bump.</li>\n\t\t</ul>\n\t\t</li>\n\t\t<li><strong>Melanoma</strong> often appears as:\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t<li>A mole that changes shape, color, texture, or starts to bleed.</li>\n\t\t<li>A large, brownish, speckled spot.</li>\n\t\t<li>A small irregular spot that appears blue, black, red, or white around the edges.</li>\n\t\t<li>Dark lesions in your mouth, lining of your vagina or anus, or on the palms of your hands, bottoms of your feet, fingertips, or toes.</li>\n\t\t</ul>\n\t\t</li>\n\t\t</ul>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t<h3>What can you do to prevent it?</h3>\n\t\t<p>Skin cancer prevention is within your control. Follow these simple steps to reduce your risk:</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"module standard-list\">\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t<li>Wear sunscreen all year long.</li>\n\t\t<li>Avoid the sun at high points of the day.</li>\n\t\t<li>Don’t use tanning beds.</li>\n\t\t<li>Wear protective clothing.</li>\n\t\t<li>Men and women, especially over age 18, should always request a skin exam during regular health check-ups.</li>\n\t\t<li>See your dermatologist regularly for thorough skins checks, early detection, and treatment.</li>\n\t\t</ul>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t<h3>What type of doctor treats skin cancer?</h3>\n\t\t<p>Most skin cancers can be removed in-office by your dermatologist. However, if your skin cancer is more advanced, you may require a cancer treatment team that could include surgical oncologists, medical oncologists, or radiation oncologists.</p>\n\t",

That body system includes the blood vessels outside of your heart, which carry blood to parts of your body like your brain, abdomen and extremities.</p>\n\t\t<h3>Who performs vascular lab tests?</h3>\n\t\t<p>Our highly dedicated, well-trained and credentialed vascular technologists will do all that they can to make you feel comfortable during your visit to our vascular lab. We are very proud of our vascular testing accreditation through the Intersocietal Accreditation Commission. It’s one more way to show you how we ensure excellent, quality testing for you.</p>\n\t\t<p>Also good to know: The tests, including vascular ultrasounds, in our labs are non-invasive. That means there’s no need to insert an instrument or device through your skin or into your body. There is also no exposure to radiation because we use sound waves.&nbsp;</p>\n\t\t<p>Once completed, all of our studies are reviewed by one of our board-certified vascular physicians.</p>\n\t\t<p>Jobst Vascular Laboratory is also an education site for local vascular ultrasound training programs including: Owens Community College and Jackson College.</p>\n\t\t<p class=\"pro-callout pro-callout--purple\">Call us today at <a rel=\"tel\" href=\"tel:+18003956278\">1-800-39-JOBST (56278)</a> to schedule an appointment.</p>\n\t\t<h3>What kinds of vascular studies are offered?</h3>\n\t\t<p>Jobst Vascular Laboratory is a full-service laboratory that provides many different types of state-of-the-art diagnostic tests. But vascular ultrasound is the most important tool in our lab and the one we use the most.</p>\n\t\t<p>A duplex vascular ultrasound uses sound waves to take pictures of your vessels and a Doppler to listen to blood flow through your arteries and veins. The exam is painless and easy for you. But it provides invaluable information for your physician.</p>\n\t\t<p>Studies performed in our vascular lab include:</p>\n\t\t<ul class=\"standard-list module\">\n\t\t<li>Cerebrovascular studies of the blood flow to the brain: Carotid artery duplex, transcranial artery Doppler (TCD)</li>\n\t\t<li>Venous: <a href=\"/services-and-conditions/deep-vein-thrombosis\">DVT (deep venous thrombosis)</a>, CVI (chronic venous insufficiency)</li>\n\t\t<li>Arterial studies to determine the amount of blood flow in your arms and legs: ankle-brachial Index (ABI), pulse volume recording (PVR), segmental pressures, duplex scan graft surveillance</li>\n\t\t<li>Abdominal studies to check the blood flow in the arteries and veins in the abdominal cavity: <a href=\"/services-and-conditions/ultrasound\">ultrasound </a>of the inferior vena cava, aorta, kidney and visceral arteries</li>\n\t\t</ul>\n\t\t<h3>Where are your labs located?</h3>\n\t\t<p>We have several vascular labs in convenient ProMedica locations across northwest Ohio and southeast Michigan.Each of these locations provides vascular ultraound services.</p>\n\n\t",

    "content": {
      "articleContent": "\n\t\t<h2>What Is a Vasectomy?</h2>\n\t\t<p>A vasectomy is a permanent and effective form of birth control for men. During the procedure, your vas deferens, the tube that carries sperm from your testes, is cut and sealed. This blocks sperm from reaching semen so that, when ejaculated, it cannot get a woman pregnant.</p>\n\t\t<p>The procedure typically takes 20-30 minutes and is safe with few side effects. Usually within a couple of days, you’re feeling better and back to your normal routine.</p>\n\t\t<p class=\"pro-callout pro-callout--purple\">Call <a href=\"tel:+18448558326\" rel=\"tel\">1-844-855-TEAM</a> for a consultation.</p>\n\t\t<h3>Types of Vasectomies</h3>\n\t\t<p>Two most common types include:</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"module standard-list\">\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t<li><strong>Conventional vasectomy.</strong> During this more traditional method, small cuts are made on each side of the scrotum to reach the vas deferens, which are cut, tied or fastened with a metal clip.</li>\n\t\t<li><strong>No scalpel vasectomy.</strong> This newer, more modern method is done through one tiny hole in the skin. A tool is used to gently stretch the skin opening so that the vas deferens can be reached. Because no cuts are made, there is little bleeding. It heals quickly with little or no scarring.</li>\n\t\t</ul>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t<h3>Debunking the Myths about Vasectomy</h3>\n\t\t<p>It’s normal to have questions and concerns about a vasectomy, but sometimes myths about the procedure can lead to unfounded concerns. Here’s the truth about vasectomies. A vasectomy:</p>\n\t\t<ul class=\"standard-list module\">\n\t\t<li><strong>Won’t affect your sexual performance. </strong>A vasectomy won’t affect your sex drive or your&nbsp;masculinity in any way other than preventing you from fathering a child. Men have even reported higher sexual satisfaction after a vasectomy.</li>\n\t\t<li><strong>Is safe for your sexual organs. </strong> There's very little risk that your testicles, penis or other parts of your reproductive system will be injured during surgery.</li>\n\t\t<li><strong>Doesn't increase your risk of certain cancers</strong>Although there have been some concerns about a possible link between having a vasectomy and getting testicular or prostate cancer in the past, there's no proven link.</li>\n\t\t<li><strong>Doesn’t increase your risk of heart disease. </strong> As with cancer fears, there doesn't appear to be any link between vasectomy and heart problems.</li>\n\t\t<li><strong>Causes minor, not severe, pain.</strong> You might feel minor pain and pulling or tugging during surgery, but severe pain is rare. Likewise, after surgery you might have some pain, but for most men the pain is minor and goes away after a few days.</li>\n\t\t</ul>\n\t\t<h2 id=\"faqaccordion\">ProMedica Vasectomy FAQs</h2>\n\t\t<div class=\"panel-group\" role=\"tablist\" aria-multiselectable=\"true\">\n\t\t<div class=\"panel panel-default\">\n\t\t<div class=\"panel-heading\" role=\"tab\" id=\"heading1\">\n\t\t<h3 class=\"panel-title\"><a class=\"collapsed\" role=\"button\" data-toggle=\"collapse\" data-parent=\"#accordion\" href=\"#faq1\" aria-expanded=\"false\" aria-controls=\"faq1\">Is a vasectomy right for me?</a></h3>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t<div id=\"faq1\" class=\"panel-collapse collapse\" role=\"tabpanel\" aria-labelledby=\"heading1\" aria-expanded=\"false\">\n\t\t<div class=\"panel-body\">\n\t\t<p>Choosing a vasectomy as a form of birth control is a major decision. You should be 100% sure that it is the right decision for you before undergoing this procedure. You and your partner should talk about the decision to not have any more children. Having a vasectomy may be a good choice if:</p>\n\t\t<ul class=\"standard-list module\">\n\t\t<li>You are an adult male and you are either done having children or don’t want to have children.</li>\n\t\t<li>You are in a stable relationship and both partners agree to permanent birth control.</li>\n\t\t<li>Pregnancy would be a health risk for your partner.</li>\n\t\t<li>You or your partner has a genetic disorder that you don’t want to pass on to a child.</li>\n\t\t</ul>\n\t\t<p>To learn more about a vasectomy and ask questions to determine if it is right for you, schedule a consultation with one of our board-certified urologists.</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t<div class=\"panel panel-default\">\n\t\t<div class=\"panel-heading\" role=\"tab\" id=\"heading6\">\n\t\t<h3 class=\"panel-title\"><a class=\"collapsed\" role=\"button\" data-toggle=\"collapse\" data-parent=\"#accordion\" href=\"#faq6\" aria-expanded=\"false\" aria-controls=\"faq6\">How do I prepare for a vasectomy?</a></h3>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t<div id=\"faq6\" class=\"panel-collapse collapse\" role=\"tabpanel\" aria-labelledby=\"heading6\" aria-expanded=\"false\">\n\t\t<div class=\"panel-body\">\n\t\t<p>It is important that you share your medical history with the doctor; include information about drugs (both prescription and over-the-counter), as well as supplements, you are taking.

It takes about 20 - 30 minutes to complete the procedure.</p>\n\t\t<p>Generally, here’s what happens during a vasectomy:</p>\n\t\t<ul class=\"standard-list module\">\n\t\t<li>You will be asked to remove any jewelry or other objects that might get in the way during the procedure.</li>\n\t\t<li>You will remove your clothing and put on a hospital gown.</li>\n\t\t<li>You will be asked to empty your bladder.</li>\n\t\t<li>You will lie on your back on an exam table.</li>\n\t\t<li>Your scrotum may be shaved and cleaned with an antiseptic solution or special soap.</li>\n\t\t<li>The surgeon will inject a numbing medicine into your scrotum.</li>\n\t\t<li>The doctor will make either a small cut or opening on one side of your scrotum to find the vas deferens, which will be cut, tied or fastened with a metal clip. The site is closed and a bandage applied. The procedure is repeated on the other side of the scrotum to block the second vas deferens.</li>\n\t\t<li>In many cases, both vas deferens can be reached through the same hole.</li>\n\t\t<li>In some cases, small stitches or skin glue may be used to close the cuts.</li>\n\t\t</ul>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t<div class=\"panel panel-default\">\n\t\t<div class=\"panel-heading\" role=\"tab\" id=\"heading8\">\n\t\t<h3 class=\"panel-title\"><a class=\"collapsed\" role=\"button\" data-toggle=\"collapse\" data-parent=\"#accordion\" href=\"#faq8\" aria-expanded=\"false\" aria-controls=\"faq8\">What happens after a vasectomy?</a></h3>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t<div id=\"faq8\" class=\"panel-collapse collapse\" role=\"tabpanel\" aria-labelledby=\"heading8\" aria-expanded=\"false\">\n\t\t<div class=\"panel-body\">\n\t\t<p>You will likely be able to go home soon after surgery. The staff will watch you closely and the doctor may give you pain medication. You may be told to use an ice pack for the first day to reduce pain and swelling. Here is what you may expect during recovery:</p>\n\t\t<ul class=\"standard-list module\">\n\t\t<li>Rest at home the day after surgery. Don't do any strenuous activity. Avoid standing or walking too long.</li>\n\t\t<li>Depending on the type of work you do, you may be able to go back in 1 to 3 days.</li>\n\t\t<li>You should be able to return to most activities in a week, but avoid heavy lifting and hard exercise for up to 1 to 3 weeks.</li>\n\t\t<li>You may need to wear a jock strap for a few days.</li>\n\t\t<li>You should not bathe or swim until 1 to 2 days after your vasectomy.</li>\n\t\t<li>You may be able to return to sexual activity in about a week, but you should continue to use another form of birth control until the doctor tests the semen to be sure there are no sperm left. This test is often performed about two months after surgery. It is important to know that vasectomies will occasionally fail and checking semen samples afterwards to confirm sterility is strongly recommended.</li>\n\t\t</ul>\n\t\t<p>Vasectomy is very safe, but all surgeries carry some risks. Tell your doctor if you have any of the following:</p>\n\t\t<ul class=\"standard-list module\">\n\t\t<li>A lump in your scrotum</li>\n\t\t<li>Any drainage, bleeding, redness, or swelling</li>\n\t\t<li>Fever</li>\n\t\t<li>Chills</li>\n\t\t<li>Increasing pain or pain that is not eased by medicine</li>\n\t\t<li>Trouble passing urine</li>\n\t\t<li>Bleeding disorders</li>\n\t\t</ul>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t<div class=\"panel panel-default\">\n\t\t<div class=\"panel-heading\" role=\"tab\" id=\"heading9\">\n\t\t<h3 class=\"panel-title\"><a class=\"collapsed\" role=\"button\" data-toggle=\"collapse\" data-parent=\"#accordion\" href=\"#faq9\" aria-expanded=\"false\" aria-controls=\"faq9\">Can I have my vasectomy reversed?</a></h3>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t<div id=\"faq9\" class=\"panel-collapse collapse\" role=\"tabpanel\" aria-labelledby=\"heading9\" aria-expanded=\"false\">\n\t\t<div class=\"panel-body\">\n\t\t<p>Possibly. Some vasectomies may be reversed, but the process can be more difficult than the actual vasectomy, isn’t always successful and can be expensive.

X-ray— using radiation passing through the body to produce an image on a special film —was discovered in 1885, and is considered a milestone in the development of modern medicine. For the first time, physicians were able to see inside the body to detect injury and disease, often in its early stages when the illness or injury is most treatable.</p>\n\t\t<h3>What to Expect During an X-ray</h3>\n\t\t<p>During an x-ray, a machine is used to send x-rays through your body. Radiation is absorbed by the more dense parts of your body, which produces a lighter image on the x-ray picture called a radiograph. The less dense areas of the body (soft tissue) absorb less radiation and appear darker on the x-ray.</p>\n\t\t<p>Common x-ray studies used to detect disease and injury include:</p>\n\t\t<ul class=\"module standard-list\">\n\t\t<li>Chest Exam - used to diagnose diseases of the heart and lungs</li>\n\t\t<li>Bone Studies - used to determine the relationship between bones and visualize fractures</li>\n\t\t<li>Digestive System Studies - used to detect diseases such as ulcers and tumors.</li>\n\t\t<li>Searching for Foreign Bodies - used to locate objects in the body that should not be there</li>\n\t\t<li>Intravenous Pyelogram (IVP) - Used to study the kidneys and ureters to the bladder.</li>\n\t\t</ul>\n\t",
