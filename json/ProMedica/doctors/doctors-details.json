She has a reputation as the 'baby whisperer' when it comes to rocking a baby to sleep. Brooke enjoys people and feels it is special to have the privilege to care for multiple generations by referral.",

Gynecologists can also help diagnose cervical, uterine, and ovarian cancer. They treat irregularities or painful conditions in people who menstruate and counsel on contraception.<br /><br />Care philosophy: Dr. Craig’s care philosophy is centered around listening and collaboration. She believes in listening to her patients’ biggest questions and concerns, reviewing the most up-to-date and pertinent treatment options a patient may have, and deciding upon a plan together. <br /><br />Conditions treated: Routine and high-risk pregnancies, painful or irregular menstrual periods. Contraception, fibroids, sexual health, menopause, routine screening<br /><br />Procedures performed:  Minimally invasive (robotic) surgery, including hysterectomy, removal of fallopian tubes (salpingectomy) or ovaries (oophorectomy); endometrial ablation, hysteroscopy<br /><br />More about me: Dr. Craig grew up all over the country, but found her home in Northwest Ohio with her husband and two golden retrievers.   In her spare time, you’ll find her enjoying the great food Toledo has to offer, watching a Wolverine or Green Bay football game, or cooking a new recipe.<br />",

Obstetrics is the field that focuses on caring for women while they are pregnant and during the postpartum period, after the baby is born.  Gynecology is a women’s health specialty that screens for and treats diseases and conditions of the female reproductive organs. Gynecologists can also help diagnose cervical, uterine, and ovarian cancer. They treat irregularities or painful conditions in people who menstruate and counsel on contraception.<br /><br />Care philosophy: Dr. Craig’s care philosophy is centered around listening and collaboration. She believes in listening to her patients’ biggest questions and concerns, reviewing the most up-to-date and pertinent treatment options a patient may have, and deciding upon a plan together. <br /><br />Conditions treated: Routine and high-risk pregnancies, painful or irregular menstrual periods. Contraception, fibroids, sexual health, menopause, routine screening<br /><br />Procedures performed:  Minimally invasive (robotic) surgery, including hysterectomy, removal of fallopian tubes (salpingectomy) or ovaries (oophorectomy); endometrial ablation, hysteroscopy<br /><br />More about me: Dr. Craig grew up all over the country, but found her home in Northwest Ohio with her husband and two golden retrievers.   In her spare time, you’ll find her enjoying the great food Toledo has to offer, watching a Wolverine or Green Bay football game, or cooking a new recipe.<br />",

Obstetrics is the field that focuses on caring for women while they are pregnant and during the postpartum period, after the baby is born.  Gynecology is a women’s health specialty that screens for and treats diseases and conditions of the female reproductive organs. Gynecologists can also help diagnose cervical, uterine, and ovarian cancer. They treat irregularities or painful conditions in people who menstruate and counsel on contraception.<br /><br />Care philosophy: Dr. Craig’s care philosophy is centered around listening and collaboration. She believes in listening to her patients’ biggest questions and concerns, reviewing the most up-to-date and pertinent treatment options a patient may have, and deciding upon a plan together. <br /><br />Conditions treated: Routine and high-risk pregnancies, painful or irregular menstrual periods. Contraception, fibroids, sexual health, menopause, routine screening<br /><br />Procedures performed:  Minimally invasive (robotic) surgery, including hysterectomy, removal of fallopian tubes (salpingectomy) or ovaries (oophorectomy); endometrial ablation, hysteroscopy<br /><br />More about me: Dr. Craig grew up all over the country, but found her home in Northwest Ohio with her husband and two golden retrievers.   In her spare time, you’ll find her enjoying the great food Toledo has to offer, watching a Wolverine or Green Bay football game, or cooking a new recipe.<br />",

Gynecology is a women's health specialty that screens for and treats diseases and conditions of the female reproductive organs. Gynecologists help diagnose cervical and ovarian cancers and treat irregularities or painful conditions in people who menstruate.<br />Care philosophy: While attending the University of Michigan, Dr. Drenchko rowed varsity crew. Being a student-athlete for four years largely inspired his philosophy of a team approach to healthcare.  The patient is always the team leader and he serves to be a promotional aspect of her healthcare journey.<br />More about me: Dr. Drenchko was raised in Shelby Township, Michigan. His father was an OB/GYN and his mother was a figure skating instructor. When he is not practicing medicine, he enjoys staying active; training at a gym or being outdoors. He loves to spend time with his family and friends. He's also a car and motorcycle enthusiast and can often be found riding his motorcycle at local raceways.<br />A huge passion of Dr. Drenchko's is education. He is always working to educate himself through evidence-based literature and presentations. He is part of ProMedica's quality committee because providing exceptional evidenced based care is very important to him. He works hard to educate his patients so they can make informed decisions about their care. He also always looks forward to educating resident physicians and medical students. Dr. Drenchko is grateful and excited to be part of the new wave in promoting and optimizing women’s health care.",

Gynecology is a women's health specialty that screens for and treats diseases and conditions of the female reproductive organs. Gynecologists help diagnose cervical and ovarian cancers and treat irregularities or painful conditions in people who menstruate.<br />Care philosophy: While attending the University of Michigan, Dr. Drenchko rowed varsity crew. Being a student-athlete for four years largely inspired his philosophy of a team approach to healthcare.  The patient is always the team leader and he serves to be a promotional aspect of her healthcare journey.<br />More about me: Dr. Drenchko was raised in Shelby Township, Michigan. His father was an OB/GYN and his mother was a figure skating instructor. When he is not practicing medicine, he enjoys staying active; training at a gym or being outdoors. He loves to spend time with his family and friends. He's also a car and motorcycle enthusiast and can often be found riding his motorcycle at local raceways.<br />A huge passion of Dr. Drenchko's is education. He is always working to educate himself through evidence-based literature and presentations. He is part of ProMedica's quality committee because providing exceptional evidenced based care is very important to him. He works hard to educate his patients so they can make informed decisions about their care. He also always looks forward to educating resident physicians and medical students. Dr. Drenchko is grateful and excited to be part of the new wave in promoting and optimizing women’s health care.",

Gynecology is a women's health specialty that screens for and treats diseases and conditions of the female reproductive organs. Gynecologists help diagnose cervical and ovarian cancers and treat irregularities or painful conditions in people who menstruate.<br />Care philosophy: While attending the University of Michigan, Dr. Drenchko rowed varsity crew. Being a student-athlete for four years largely inspired his philosophy of a team approach to healthcare.  The patient is always the team leader and he serves to be a promotional aspect of her healthcare journey.<br />More about me: Dr. Drenchko was raised in Shelby Township, Michigan. His father was an OB/GYN and his mother was a figure skating instructor. When he is not practicing medicine, he enjoys staying active; training at a gym or being outdoors. He loves to spend time with his family and friends. He's also a car and motorcycle enthusiast and can often be found riding his motorcycle at local raceways.<br />A huge passion of Dr. Drenchko's is education. He is always working to educate himself through evidence-based literature and presentations. He is part of ProMedica's quality committee because providing exceptional evidenced based care is very important to him. He works hard to educate his patients so they can make informed decisions about their care. He also always looks forward to educating resident physicians and medical students. Dr. Drenchko is grateful and excited to be part of the new wave in promoting and optimizing women’s health care.",

Sarah is an exercise enthusiast, has trained for triathlons and has a passion for nutrition and all things food. In her spare time, you will find her in the kitchen or spending time with her husband and two active little boys.<br />Care philosophy<br />I believe in a holistic approach to treatment; that the mind and body are strongly connected and must be treated concurrently for the best outcomes.

My early career was heavily sports and orthopedic based, so now I combine my passion for an active lifestyle with women's health to help women return to the activities they love. It is important for the patient and provider to have a great teamwork relationship. My goal is to help patients achieve their goals, whether that is returning to daily activities, being active or even running a marathon!<br />Conditions Treated<br /> Pelvic pain, perinatal and postpartum pain/dysfunction, diastasis recti, adolescent pelvic dysfunction and pain, urinary/fecal incontinence, myofascial pain, low back and hip pain, dyspareunia (painful sex), pelvic organ prolapse, somatic pelvic dysfunction <br />Procedures Performed<br /> Pelvic floor physical therapy, manual therapy techniques, myofascial release, kinesiotaping, soft tissue mobilization, gait and running analysis.

Half of which she spent practicing as a nurse practitioner. The other half as a cardiac stepdown/ICU nurse.<br />Her interest in cardiology started when she was 14 years old. That's when her cousin died at age 6 after her third open heart surgery. Her interested deepened when she did her nursing clinicals at Medical College of Ohio (MCO) on the cardiac stepdown floor.",

Sarah is an exercise enthusiast, has trained for triathlons and has a passion for nutrition and all things food. In her spare time, you will find her in the kitchen or spending time with her husband and two active little boys.<br />Care philosophy<br />I believe in a holistic approach to treatment; that the mind and body are strongly connected and must be treated concurrently for the best outcomes. I focus heavily on education with patients to help them understand how their bodies work, what their current impairments are and how to take ownership and control back into their own hands. My early career was heavily sports and orthopedic based, so now I combine my passion for an active lifestyle with women's health to help women return to the activities they love. It is important for the patient and provider to have a great teamwork relationship. My goal is to help patients achieve their goals, whether that is returning to daily activities, being active or even running a marathon!<br />Conditions Treated<br /> Pelvic pain, perinatal and postpartum pain/dysfunction, diastasis recti, adolescent pelvic dysfunction and pain, urinary/fecal incontinence, myofascial pain, low back and hip pain, dyspareunia (painful sex), pelvic organ prolapse, somatic pelvic dysfunction <br />Procedures Performed<br /> Pelvic floor physical therapy, manual therapy techniques, myofascial release, kinesiotaping, soft tissue mobilization, gait and running analysis.

She is a board certified Orthopedic Clinical Specialist by the ABPTS. As a young mom herself, she especially enjoys and easily relates to patients in the early post-partum period. Sarah is an exercise enthusiast, has trained for triathlons and has a passion for nutrition and all things food. In her spare time, you will find her in the kitchen or spending time with her husband and two active little boys.<br />Care philosophy<br />I believe in a holistic approach to treatment; that the mind and body are strongly connected and must be treated concurrently for the best outcomes. I focus heavily on education with patients to help them understand how their bodies work, what their current impairments are and how to take ownership and control back into their own hands. My early career was heavily sports and orthopedic based, so now I combine my passion for an active lifestyle with women's health to help women return to the activities they love. It is important for the patient and provider to have a great teamwork relationship. My goal is to help patients achieve their goals, whether that is returning to daily activities, being active or even running a marathon!<br />Conditions Treated<br /> Pelvic pain, perinatal and postpartum pain/dysfunction, diastasis recti, adolescent pelvic dysfunction and pain, urinary/fecal incontinence, myofascial pain, low back and hip pain, dyspareunia (painful sex), pelvic organ prolapse, somatic pelvic dysfunction <br />Procedures Performed<br /> Pelvic floor physical therapy, manual therapy techniques, myofascial release, kinesiotaping, soft tissue mobilization, gait and running analysis.

Above all, each patient must be treated as a family member with compassion and empathy. Words of wisdom from a mentor are still with him to this day: Patient First.<br /><br />Clinical interests: More than the practice of general cardiology, he takes pride in his abilities as an interventional cardiologist. Additionally, Dr. Karamali has a keen interest in the care of oncology patients as it pertains to their cardiac risk secondary to their underlying malignancy.<br /><br />Conditions treated: Atrial fibrillation, congestive heart failure, acute coronary syndrome, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, cardiac catheterization, transesophageal echocardiography, and cardioversion.<br /><br />More about me: Dr. Karamali met his wife in college when he was a student at Boston College. She was the only one he dated there. <br /><br />ProMedica Cardiothoracic Surgeon Dr. Michael Moront is a classmate of his from college. <br /><br />Dr. Karamali was on the Olympic team for Pakistan for swimming, but he emigrated to the United States before he could compete. His father was in the 1948 Olympics for swimming for Pakistan. <br /><br />He is an avid golfer, but is not sure what he does on the course can be called “golf”.",

Above all, each patient must be treated as a family member with compassion and empathy. Words of wisdom from a mentor are still with him to this day: Patient First.<br /><br />Clinical interests: More than the practice of general cardiology, he takes pride in his abilities as an interventional cardiologist. Additionally, Dr. Karamali has a keen interest in the care of oncology patients as it pertains to their cardiac risk secondary to their underlying malignancy.<br /><br />Conditions treated: Atrial fibrillation, congestive heart failure, acute coronary syndrome, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, cardiac catheterization, transesophageal echocardiography, and cardioversion.<br /><br />More about me: Dr. Karamali met his wife in college when he was a student at Boston College. She was the only one he dated there. <br /><br />ProMedica Cardiothoracic Surgeon Dr. Michael Moront is a classmate of his from college. <br /><br />Dr. Karamali was on the Olympic team for Pakistan for swimming, but he emigrated to the United States before he could compete. His father was in the 1948 Olympics for swimming for Pakistan. <br /><br />He is an avid golfer, but is not sure what he does on the course can be called “golf”.",

Above all, each patient must be treated as a family member with compassion and empathy. Words of wisdom from a mentor are still with him to this day: Patient First.<br /><br />Clinical interests: More than the practice of general cardiology, he takes pride in his abilities as an interventional cardiologist. Additionally, Dr. Karamali has a keen interest in the care of oncology patients as it pertains to their cardiac risk secondary to their underlying malignancy.<br /><br />Conditions treated: Atrial fibrillation, congestive heart failure, acute coronary syndrome, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, cardiac catheterization, transesophageal echocardiography, and cardioversion.<br /><br />More about me: Dr. Karamali met his wife in college when he was a student at Boston College. She was the only one he dated there. <br /><br />ProMedica Cardiothoracic Surgeon Dr. Michael Moront is a classmate of his from college. <br /><br />Dr. Karamali was on the Olympic team for Pakistan for swimming, but he emigrated to the United States before he could compete. His father was in the 1948 Olympics for swimming for Pakistan. <br /><br />He is an avid golfer, but is not sure what he does on the course can be called “golf”.",

      "biography": "Rosie Li, MD is a board-certified obstetrician/gynecologist (OB/GYN).<br />Obstetrics is the medical field that focuses on caring for women while they are pregnant and during the postpartum period after the baby is born. Gynecology is a women's health specialty that screens for and treats diseases and conditions of the female reproductive organs. Gynecologists help diagnose cervical and ovarian cancers and treat irregularities or painful conditions in people who menstruate.<br />Care philosophy: Communication is at the center of Dr. Li's care philosophy. She believes that effective communication between the provider and the patient and the provider and other medical team specialties or team members is important for providing complete patient care. She wants the patient to feel like they had the opportunity to voice their concerns and ask all the questions. Additionally, she believes it is important to update all members who are involved in a particular patient's care to be on the same page to decrease miscommunication.<br /> <br />Conditions treated: Routine and high-risk pregnancy, menopause, abnormal menstrual bleeding, painful periods, contraception, endometriosis, fibroids, sexual health.<br /> <br />Procedures performed: Minimally-invasive hysterectomy, endometrial ablation, removal of fallopian tubes (salpingectomy), removal of ovaries (oophorectomy), fibroid removal (myomectomy)More about me: Dr. Li grew up in three different countries and finally settled in Baltimore. She was drawn to the Midwest after attending University of Michigan and decided to come back for medical school after completing graduate school. She and her husband settled in Toledo, Ohio after completing her OB/GYN residency.",

      "biography": "Rosie Li, MD is a board-certified obstetrician/gynecologist (OB/GYN).<br />Obstetrics is the medical field that focuses on caring for women while they are pregnant and during the postpartum period after the baby is born. Gynecology is a women's health specialty that screens for and treats diseases and conditions of the female reproductive organs. Gynecologists help diagnose cervical and ovarian cancers and treat irregularities or painful conditions in people who menstruate.<br />Care philosophy: Communication is at the center of Dr. Li's care philosophy. She believes that effective communication between the provider and the patient and the provider and other medical team specialties or team members is important for providing complete patient care. She wants the patient to feel like they had the opportunity to voice their concerns and ask all the questions. Additionally, she believes it is important to update all members who are involved in a particular patient's care to be on the same page to decrease miscommunication.<br /> <br />Conditions treated: Routine and high-risk pregnancy, menopause, abnormal menstrual bleeding, painful periods, contraception, endometriosis, fibroids, sexual health.<br /> <br />Procedures performed: Minimally-invasive hysterectomy, endometrial ablation, removal of fallopian tubes (salpingectomy), removal of ovaries (oophorectomy), fibroid removal (myomectomy)More about me: Dr. Li grew up in three different countries and finally settled in Baltimore. She was drawn to the Midwest after attending University of Michigan and decided to come back for medical school after completing graduate school. She and her husband settled in Toledo, Ohio after completing her OB/GYN residency.",

Gynecologists help diagnose cervical and ovarian cancers and treat irregularities or painful conditions in people who menstruate.<br />Care philosophy: Communication is at the center of Dr. Li's care philosophy. She believes that effective communication between the provider and the patient and the provider and other medical team specialties or team members is important for providing complete patient care. She wants the patient to feel like they had the opportunity to voice their concerns and ask all the questions. Additionally, she believes it is important to update all members who are involved in a particular patient's care to be on the same page to decrease miscommunication.<br /> <br />Conditions treated: Routine and high-risk pregnancy, menopause, abnormal menstrual bleeding, painful periods, contraception, endometriosis, fibroids, sexual health.<br /> <br />Procedures performed: Minimally-invasive hysterectomy, endometrial ablation, removal of fallopian tubes (salpingectomy), removal of ovaries (oophorectomy), fibroid removal (myomectomy)More about me: Dr. Li grew up in three different countries and finally settled in Baltimore. She was drawn to the Midwest after attending University of Michigan and decided to come back for medical school after completing graduate school.

Gynecologists help diagnose cervical and ovarian cancers and treat irregularities or painful conditions in people who menstruate.<br />Care philosophy: Communication is at the center of Dr. Li's care philosophy. She believes that effective communication between the provider and the patient and the provider and other medical team specialties or team members is important for providing complete patient care. She wants the patient to feel like they had the opportunity to voice their concerns and ask all the questions. Additionally, she believes it is important to update all members who are involved in a particular patient's care to be on the same page to decrease miscommunication.<br /> <br />Conditions treated: Routine and high-risk pregnancy, menopause, abnormal menstrual bleeding, painful periods, contraception, endometriosis, fibroids, sexual health.<br /> <br />Procedures performed: Minimally-invasive hysterectomy, endometrial ablation, removal of fallopian tubes (salpingectomy), removal of ovaries (oophorectomy), fibroid removal (myomectomy)More about me: Dr. Li grew up in three different countries and finally settled in Baltimore. She was drawn to the Midwest after attending University of Michigan and decided to come back for medical school after completing graduate school. She and her husband settled in Toledo, Ohio after completing her OB/GYN residency.",

It is also about treating a wide spectrum of diseases and being the first line of contact for the healthcare system. In doing this effectively I hope to gain the trust and establish great relationships with my patients. <br /><br />I grew up in Columbus, OH and went to The University of Toledo College of Medicine and Life Sciences for my Master’s and Medical Degree. I then completed my residency at St. Joseph Mercy Livingston Family Medicine Residency where I was the Academic Chief Resident in my last year of residency before becoming certified by the American Board of Family Medicine. <br /><br />Some interesting things that patients may not know about me would be that I have been skydiving before and I was a placekicker for John Carroll University in College. My interests include playing board games, riding bikes, personal finance, and spending time with family.<br />",

Pregnancy, labor and delivery are all natural occurrences and it's important to listen to one's body. Alisha believes that medical interventions should be saved for when they are required. She is passionate about treating patients holistically and providing evidence-based education and treatment techniques to ensure the best care.Clinical interests: Spinning babiesMore about me: Alisha has 13 years of experience in labor and delivery, providing support to patients and their families during labor. She believes in making decisions as a team and is supportive of any decisions that women and their family unit make prior to their arrival to labor and delivery. She believes that informed and supportive care is the only care and strives to make all patients and families feel comfortable.

My care philosophy is centered around my clinical interests and what I believe are the core values of family medicine which is to practice preventative medicine and help patients make life-style changes to prevent disease. It is also about treating a wide spectrum of diseases and being the first line of contact for the healthcare system. In doing this effectively I hope to gain the trust and establish great relationships with my patients. <br /><br />I grew up in Columbus, OH and went to The University of Toledo College of Medicine and Life Sciences for my Master’s and Medical Degree. I then completed my residency at St. Joseph Mercy Livingston Family Medicine Residency where I was the Academic Chief Resident in my last year of residency before becoming certified by the American Board of Family Medicine. <br /><br />Some interesting things that patients may not know about me would be that I have been skydiving before and I was a placekicker for John Carroll University in College. My interests include playing board games, riding bikes, personal finance, and spending time with family.<br />",

She is passionate about treating patients holistically and providing evidence-based education and treatment techniques to ensure the best care.Clinical interests: Spinning babiesMore about me: Alisha has 13 years of experience in labor and delivery, providing support to patients and their families during labor. She believes in making decisions as a team and is supportive of any decisions that women and their family unit make prior to their arrival to labor and delivery. She believes that informed and supportive care is the only care and strives to make all patients and families feel comfortable. She also provides labor support training to staff nurses and other midwives to help decrease the rate of cesarean deliveries.",

      "biography": "Family Medicine provides care for the entire family from birth, throughout adulthood, and into the last stages of life. My care philosophy is centered around my clinical interests and what I believe are the core values of family medicine which is to practice preventative medicine and help patients make life-style changes to prevent disease. It is also about treating a wide spectrum of diseases and being the first line of contact for the healthcare system. In doing this effectively I hope to gain the trust and establish great relationships with my patients. <br /><br />I grew up in Columbus, OH and went to The University of Toledo College of Medicine and Life Sciences for my Master’s and Medical Degree. I then completed my residency at St. Joseph Mercy Livingston Family Medicine Residency where I was the Academic Chief Resident in my last year of residency before becoming certified by the American Board of Family Medicine. <br /><br />Some interesting things that patients may not know about me would be that I have been skydiving before and I was a placekicker for John Carroll University in College. My interests include playing board games, riding bikes, personal finance, and spending time with family.<br />",

My care philosophy is centered around my clinical interests and what I believe are the core values of family medicine which is to practice preventative medicine and help patients make life-style changes to prevent disease. It is also about treating a wide spectrum of diseases and being the first line of contact for the healthcare system. In doing this effectively I hope to gain the trust and establish great relationships with my patients. <br /><br />I grew up in Columbus, OH and went to The University of Toledo College of Medicine and Life Sciences for my Master’s and Medical Degree. I then completed my residency at St. Joseph Mercy Livingston Family Medicine Residency where I was the Academic Chief Resident in my last year of residency before becoming certified by the American Board of Family Medicine. <br /><br />Some interesting things that patients may not know about me would be that I have been skydiving before and I was a placekicker for John Carroll University in College. My interests include playing board games, riding bikes, personal finance, and spending time with family.<br />",

When we identify a person that has a hereditary predisposition to develop specific cancers, it allows for medical management tailored to that persons individual risks. It may allow for additional treatment options for one’s cancer. It is also information that can be shared with family members as they may benefit from genetic counseling and possible testing.  As a Genetic Counselor, we are uniquely trained to help families understand this information and work closely with their providers to ensure they’re receiving the best possible follow-up and screening. <br /><br />Kelly appreciates many people may be unsure about the genetic counseling and genetic testing process. If you have questions, she encourages you to have an initial consult with a genetic counselor so we may address your questions and educate you regarding the options of genetic testing. Kelly looks forward to talking with you.<br /><br />",

Maternal-fetal medicine is a medical specialty that focuses on the care of women with high-risk pregnancies or pregnancy complications.

From her understanding of the journey those families go through stems her philosophy of the importance of being “present” for her patients during those times. She believes that her ability to be there and to provide support can have a long-lasting impact.<br />Clinical interests: Dr. Moussa's clinical interests include maternal medical complications during pregnancy, preterm birth and its prevention, as well as quality and safety improvement. On the fetal side, she is interested in fetal diagnosis and fetal neurodevelopment. During her fellowship training she focused her research on the fetal origins of autism etiology in relation to the maternal uterine environment, for which she received the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine excellence in research award. <br />More about me: Dr. Moussa is family oriented and enjoys spending time with her daughter, and her niece and nephews. She is multilingual and fluent in Arabic, French and English. She enjoys community outreach both professionally and socially.",

When we identify a person that has a hereditary predisposition to develop specific cancers, it allows for medical management tailored to that persons individual risks. It may allow for additional treatment options for one’s cancer. It is also information that can be shared with family members as they may benefit from genetic counseling and possible testing.  As a Genetic Counselor, we are uniquely trained to help families understand this information and work closely with their providers to ensure they’re receiving the best possible follow-up and screening. <br /><br />Kelly appreciates many people may be unsure about the genetic counseling and genetic testing process. If you have questions, she encourages you to have an initial consult with a genetic counselor so we may address your questions and educate you regarding the options of genetic testing.

Maternal-fetal medicine is a medical specialty that focuses on the care of women with high-risk pregnancies or pregnancy complications. The health of the mother and the fetus are monitored closely during pregnancy. <br />Care philosophy: As a maternal-fetal medicine specialist, Dr. Moussa believes that it is her honor and privilege to be there during some of the most exciting yet scariest moments a family may face. From her understanding of the journey those families go through stems her philosophy of the importance of being “present” for her patients during those times. She believes that her ability to be there and to provide support can have a long-lasting impact.<br />Clinical interests: Dr. Moussa's clinical interests include maternal medical complications during pregnancy, preterm birth and its prevention, as well as quality and safety improvement. On the fetal side, she is interested in fetal diagnosis and fetal neurodevelopment. During her fellowship training she focused her research on the fetal origins of autism etiology in relation to the maternal uterine environment, for which she received the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine excellence in research award. <br />More about me: Dr. Moussa is family oriented and enjoys spending time with her daughter, and her niece and nephews. She is multilingual and fluent in Arabic, French and English. She enjoys community outreach both professionally and socially.",

When we identify a person that has a hereditary predisposition to develop specific cancers, it allows for medical management tailored to that persons individual risks. It may allow for additional treatment options for one’s cancer. It is also information that can be shared with family members as they may benefit from genetic counseling and possible testing.  As a Genetic Counselor, we are uniquely trained to help families understand this information and work closely with their providers to ensure they’re receiving the best possible follow-up and screening. <br /><br />Kelly appreciates many people may be unsure about the genetic counseling and genetic testing process. If you have questions, she encourages you to have an initial consult with a genetic counselor so we may address your questions and educate you regarding the options of genetic testing.

Maternal-fetal medicine is a medical specialty that focuses on the care of women with high-risk pregnancies or pregnancy complications. The health of the mother and the fetus are monitored closely during pregnancy. <br />Care philosophy: As a maternal-fetal medicine specialist, Dr. Moussa believes that it is her honor and privilege to be there during some of the most exciting yet scariest moments a family may face. From her understanding of the journey those families go through stems her philosophy of the importance of being “present” for her patients during those times. She believes that her ability to be there and to provide support can have a long-lasting impact.<br />Clinical interests: Dr. Moussa's clinical interests include maternal medical complications during pregnancy, preterm birth and its prevention, as well as quality and safety improvement. On the fetal side, she is interested in fetal diagnosis and fetal neurodevelopment. During her fellowship training she focused her research on the fetal origins of autism etiology in relation to the maternal uterine environment, for which she received the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine excellence in research award. <br />More about me: Dr. Moussa is family oriented and enjoys spending time with her daughter, and her niece and nephews. She is multilingual and fluent in Arabic, French and English. She enjoys community outreach both professionally and socially.",

Cardiac electrophysiology is a field within cardiology that specializes in heart conditions that cause arrhythmias such as atrial fibrillation. The specialty also encompasses heart rhythm disorders that requires pacemakers and defibrillators.<br /><br />Dr. Phelan is board-certified in clinical cardiac electrophysiology, cardiovascular disease, and internal medicine. <br /><br />Care philosophy: He believes in taking time to know his patients and to understand what is important to them. He also believes that not every treatment is the right choice for every patient. <br /><br />Conditions treated: Atrial fibrillation, ventricular tachycardia (VT), supraventricular tachycardia (SVT), and cardiomyopathy.Procedures/treatments performed: Cardiac ablations, pacemaker insertion, implantable cardioverter-defibrillator insertion, and cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT/biventricular devices).  <br /><br />More about me: His personal career interests include complex ablations of both atrial and ventricular arrhythmias. In addition, he often participates in various multi-center research trials designed to improve future treatments for patients.<br /><br />Dr. Phelan is originally from Baltimore, Maryland where most of his early medical education took place. He met his wife while they both were pursuing their medical training in Richmond, Virginia. He and his wife have both been practicing in the Toledo area since 2017.<br />",
