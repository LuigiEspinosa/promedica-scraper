Clinically, I am interested in Normal Pressure Hydrocephalus (NPH), Cervical myelopathy, Craniosynostosis, Brain tumors, Lumbar fusion and Revision Lumbar fusion (PLIF/TLIF).  I am trained in pedicle screw placement and fixation as well as Normal Pressure Hydrocephalus (NPH).<br /> <br /><br /><br />",

Midwives are trained professionals who help women with lower-risk pregnancies deliver their babies with fewer medical interventions.<br />Care philosophy: To Hana, midwifery is a practice of women-centered care. She believes it is her role to empower women to take an active role in their healthcare and work in partnership as she supports them through any life event.  Whether it is pregnancy, childbirth, gynecologic issues, or general wellness, Hana looks to provide space where all women are felt well cared for and respected.<br />More about me: When Hana is not caring for women, she enjoys spending her time traveling, staying active, and being with friends and family and caring for her three girls. She is originally from Toledo/Sylvania and is excited to care for women in her community.",

She believes it is her role to empower women to take an active role in their healthcare and work in partnership as she supports them through any life event.  Whether it is pregnancy, childbirth, gynecologic issues, or general wellness, Hana looks to provide space where all women are felt well cared for and respected.<br />More about me: When Hana is not caring for women, she enjoys spending her time traveling, staying active, and being with friends and family and caring for her three girls. She is originally from Toledo/Sylvania and is excited to care for women in her community.",

She believes it is her role to empower women to take an active role in their healthcare and work in partnership as she supports them through any life event.  Whether it is pregnancy, childbirth, gynecologic issues, or general wellness, Hana looks to provide space where all women are felt well cared for and respected.<br />More about me: When Hana is not caring for women, she enjoys spending her time traveling, staying active, and being with friends and family and caring for her three girls. She is originally from Toledo/Sylvania and is excited to care for women in her community.",

Obstetrics is the field that focuses on caring for women while they are pregnant and during the postpartum period, after the baby is born.  Gynecology is a women’s health specialty that screens for and treats diseases and conditions of the female reproductive organs. Gynecologists can also help diagnose cervical, uterine, and ovarian cancer. They treat irregularities or painful conditions in people who menstruate and counsel on contraception.<br /><br />Care philosophy: Dr. Craig’s care philosophy is centered around listening and collaboration. She believes in listening to her patients’ biggest questions and concerns, reviewing the most up-to-date and pertinent treatment options a patient may have, and deciding upon a plan together. <br /><br />Conditions treated: Routine and high-risk pregnancies, painful or irregular menstrual periods. Contraception, fibroids, sexual health, menopause, routine screening<br /><br />Procedures performed:  Minimally invasive (robotic) surgery, including hysterectomy, removal of fallopian tubes (salpingectomy) or ovaries (oophorectomy); endometrial ablation, hysteroscopy<br /><br />More about me: Dr. Craig grew up all over the country, but found her home in Northwest Ohio with her husband and two golden retrievers.   In her spare time, you’ll find her enjoying the great food Toledo has to offer, watching a Wolverine or Green Bay football game, or cooking a new recipe.<br />",

Obstetrics is the field that focuses on caring for women while they are pregnant and during the postpartum period, after the baby is born.  Gynecology is a women’s health specialty that screens for and treats diseases and conditions of the female reproductive organs. Gynecologists can also help diagnose cervical, uterine, and ovarian cancer. They treat irregularities or painful conditions in people who menstruate and counsel on contraception.<br /><br />Care philosophy: Dr. Craig’s care philosophy is centered around listening and collaboration. She believes in listening to her patients’ biggest questions and concerns, reviewing the most up-to-date and pertinent treatment options a patient may have, and deciding upon a plan together. <br /><br />Conditions treated: Routine and high-risk pregnancies, painful or irregular menstrual periods. Contraception, fibroids, sexual health, menopause, routine screening<br /><br />Procedures performed:  Minimally invasive (robotic) surgery, including hysterectomy, removal of fallopian tubes (salpingectomy) or ovaries (oophorectomy); endometrial ablation, hysteroscopy<br /><br />More about me: Dr. Craig grew up all over the country, but found her home in Northwest Ohio with her husband and two golden retrievers.   In her spare time, you’ll find her enjoying the great food Toledo has to offer, watching a Wolverine or Green Bay football game, or cooking a new recipe.<br />",

Obstetrics is the field that focuses on caring for women while they are pregnant and during the postpartum period, after the baby is born.  Gynecology is a women’s health specialty that screens for and treats diseases and conditions of the female reproductive organs. Gynecologists can also help diagnose cervical, uterine, and ovarian cancer. They treat irregularities or painful conditions in people who menstruate and counsel on contraception.<br /><br />Care philosophy: Dr. Craig’s care philosophy is centered around listening and collaboration. She believes in listening to her patients’ biggest questions and concerns, reviewing the most up-to-date and pertinent treatment options a patient may have, and deciding upon a plan together. <br /><br />Conditions treated: Routine and high-risk pregnancies, painful or irregular menstrual periods. Contraception, fibroids, sexual health, menopause, routine screening<br /><br />Procedures performed:  Minimally invasive (robotic) surgery, including hysterectomy, removal of fallopian tubes (salpingectomy) or ovaries (oophorectomy); endometrial ablation, hysteroscopy<br /><br />More about me: Dr. Craig grew up all over the country, but found her home in Northwest Ohio with her husband and two golden retrievers.   In her spare time, you’ll find her enjoying the great food Toledo has to offer, watching a Wolverine or Green Bay football game, or cooking a new recipe.<br />",

      "biography": "Robert Drenchko, DO is a board-certified obstetrician/gynecologist (OB/GYN). <br />Obstetrics is the medical field that focuses on caring for women while they are pregnant and during the postpartum period after the baby is born. Gynecology is a women's health specialty that screens for and treats diseases and conditions of the female reproductive organs. Gynecologists help diagnose cervical and ovarian cancers and treat irregularities or painful conditions in people who menstruate.<br />Care philosophy: While attending the University of Michigan, Dr. Drenchko rowed varsity crew. Being a student-athlete for four years largely inspired his philosophy of a team approach to healthcare.  The patient is always the team leader and he serves to be a promotional aspect of her healthcare journey.<br />More about me: Dr. Drenchko was raised in Shelby Township, Michigan. His father was an OB/GYN and his mother was a figure skating instructor. When he is not practicing medicine, he enjoys staying active; training at a gym or being outdoors. He loves to spend time with his family and friends. He's also a car and motorcycle enthusiast and can often be found riding his motorcycle at local raceways.<br />A huge passion of Dr. Drenchko's is education. He is always working to educate himself through evidence-based literature and presentations. He is part of ProMedica's quality committee because providing exceptional evidenced based care is very important to him. He works hard to educate his patients so they can make informed decisions about their care. He also always looks forward to educating resident physicians and medical students. Dr. Drenchko is grateful and excited to be part of the new wave in promoting and optimizing women’s health care.",

Gynecology is a women's health specialty that screens for and treats diseases and conditions of the female reproductive organs. Gynecologists help diagnose cervical and ovarian cancers and treat irregularities or painful conditions in people who menstruate.<br />Care philosophy: While attending the University of Michigan, Dr. Drenchko rowed varsity crew. Being a student-athlete for four years largely inspired his philosophy of a team approach to healthcare.  The patient is always the team leader and he serves to be a promotional aspect of her healthcare journey.<br />More about me: Dr. Drenchko was raised in Shelby Township, Michigan. His father was an OB/GYN and his mother was a figure skating instructor. When he is not practicing medicine, he enjoys staying active; training at a gym or being outdoors. He loves to spend time with his family and friends. He's also a car and motorcycle enthusiast and can often be found riding his motorcycle at local raceways.<br />A huge passion of Dr. Drenchko's is education. He is always working to educate himself through evidence-based literature and presentations. He is part of ProMedica's quality committee because providing exceptional evidenced based care is very important to him. He works hard to educate his patients so they can make informed decisions about their care. He also always looks forward to educating resident physicians and medical students. Dr. Drenchko is grateful and excited to be part of the new wave in promoting and optimizing women’s health care.",

      "biography": "Robert Drenchko, DO is a board-certified obstetrician/gynecologist (OB/GYN). <br />Obstetrics is the medical field that focuses on caring for women while they are pregnant and during the postpartum period after the baby is born. Gynecology is a women's health specialty that screens for and treats diseases and conditions of the female reproductive organs. Gynecologists help diagnose cervical and ovarian cancers and treat irregularities or painful conditions in people who menstruate.<br />Care philosophy: While attending the University of Michigan, Dr. Drenchko rowed varsity crew. Being a student-athlete for four years largely inspired his philosophy of a team approach to healthcare.  The patient is always the team leader and he serves to be a promotional aspect of her healthcare journey.<br />More about me: Dr. Drenchko was raised in Shelby Township, Michigan. His father was an OB/GYN and his mother was a figure skating instructor. When he is not practicing medicine, he enjoys staying active; training at a gym or being outdoors. He loves to spend time with his family and friends. He's also a car and motorcycle enthusiast and can often be found riding his motorcycle at local raceways.<br />A huge passion of Dr. Drenchko's is education. He is always working to educate himself through evidence-based literature and presentations. He is part of ProMedica's quality committee because providing exceptional evidenced based care is very important to him. He works hard to educate his patients so they can make informed decisions about their care. He also always looks forward to educating resident physicians and medical students. Dr. Drenchko is grateful and excited to be part of the new wave in promoting and optimizing women’s health care.",

I enjoy outdoor activities and camping with our family as well as spending time with my network of girlfriends supporting each other as we navigate through motherhood. <br />Care Philosophy <br />I believe in a patient centered approach to care, advocating on their behalf for their specific concerns and treatment goals. I strive to focus on patient education for better patient understanding of their condition to empower them to achieve their best outcomes with a treatment plan specifically catered for their needs. <br />Conditions Treated <br />Pregnancy and post-partum pain, chronic pelvic pain, diastasis recti, dyspareunia (painful sex), pelvic organ prolapse, stress and urge urinary incontinence, abdominal pain, constipation, fecal incontinence. <br />Procedures Performed: <br />    Pelvic Floor Physical Therapy <br />    Manual Therapy <br />    Myofascial Release <br />    Soft Tissue Mobilization <br />    Patient education <br />    Bowel/bladder education<br />",

      "biography": "Adil Karamali, MD, FACC is a cardiologist. Cardiology is the study of heart conditions. <br /><br />Dr. Karamali is board-certified in internal medicine and critical care.   <br /><br />Care philosophy: Dr. Karamali’s main goal is to keep a patient’s heart healthy. Above all, each patient must be treated as a family member with compassion and empathy. Words of wisdom from a mentor are still with him to this day: Patient First.<br /><br />Clinical interests: More than the practice of general cardiology, he takes pride in his abilities as an interventional cardiologist. Additionally, Dr. Karamali has a keen interest in the care of oncology patients as it pertains to their cardiac risk secondary to their underlying malignancy.<br /><br />Conditions treated: Atrial fibrillation, congestive heart failure, acute coronary syndrome, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, cardiac catheterization, transesophageal echocardiography, and cardioversion.<br /><br />More about me: Dr. Karamali met his wife in college when he was a student at Boston College. She was the only one he dated there. <br /><br />ProMedica Cardiothoracic Surgeon Dr. Michael Moront is a classmate of his from college. <br /><br />Dr. Karamali was on the Olympic team for Pakistan for swimming, but he emigrated to the United States before he could compete. His father was in the 1948 Olympics for swimming for Pakistan. <br /><br />He is an avid golfer, but is not sure what he does on the course can be called “golf”.",

Cardiology is the study of heart conditions. <br /><br />Dr. Karamali is board-certified in internal medicine and critical care.   <br /><br />Care philosophy: Dr. Karamali’s main goal is to keep a patient’s heart healthy. Above all, each patient must be treated as a family member with compassion and empathy. Words of wisdom from a mentor are still with him to this day: Patient First.<br /><br />Clinical interests: More than the practice of general cardiology, he takes pride in his abilities as an interventional cardiologist. Additionally, Dr. Karamali has a keen interest in the care of oncology patients as it pertains to their cardiac risk secondary to their underlying malignancy.<br /><br />Conditions treated: Atrial fibrillation, congestive heart failure, acute coronary syndrome, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, cardiac catheterization, transesophageal echocardiography, and cardioversion.<br /><br />More about me: Dr. Karamali met his wife in college when he was a student at Boston College. She was the only one he dated there. <br /><br />ProMedica Cardiothoracic Surgeon Dr. Michael Moront is a classmate of his from college. <br /><br />Dr. Karamali was on the Olympic team for Pakistan for swimming, but he emigrated to the United States before he could compete. His father was in the 1948 Olympics for swimming for Pakistan. <br /><br />He is an avid golfer, but is not sure what he does on the course can be called “golf”.",

She continued her education to become a Nurse Practitioner for 20+ of those years, to care for people seeking improvement in their own mental health.  As our lives change, stressors occur, and things around us evolve, Danine’s philosophy is to treat others the way she would like herself and her family to be treated for mental health issues.  We are human beings and the brain is an organ that we cannot live without and requires some special care just as other organs require.Her clinical interests have varied since each person presents a unique opportunity to meet their needs which involves other conditions, environment, strengths, and willingness to work hard and accept the help of a team of recommended resources.  Many people have pain issues, sleep concerns, loneliness to be heard, reassurance of being human and not crazy, and too many more conditions to be named.  Danine continues reading the latest research and science publications of new medications, treatments, combined treatments, and discusses with others via networks of associations with other national and international nurse practitioners and psychiatrists.She enjoys what she does, enjoys meeting the many people she has met throughout her career and looks forward to meeting many new people going forward.  Danine recognizes she do not have all the answers, not even close, but she appreciates the hard work each person has done between appointments and has taken on any hurdles or bumps along the way to improving their mental health to enjoy the moment and plan their future.  Each person that reaches their individual optimum mental health becomes a success that brings smiles, laughter, and just conversation of hard work that brightens their life and future!",

We are human beings and the brain is an organ that we cannot live without and requires some special care just as other organs require.Her clinical interests have varied since each person presents a unique opportunity to meet their needs which involves other conditions, environment, strengths, and willingness to work hard and accept the help of a team of recommended resources.  Many people have pain issues, sleep concerns, loneliness to be heard, reassurance of being human and not crazy, and too many more conditions to be named.  Danine continues reading the latest research and science publications of new medications, treatments, combined treatments, and discusses with others via networks of associations with other national and international nurse practitioners and psychiatrists.She enjoys what she does, enjoys meeting the many people she has met throughout her career and looks forward to meeting many new people going forward.  Danine recognizes she do not have all the answers, not even close, but she appreciates the hard work each person has done between appointments and has taken on any hurdles or bumps along the way to improving their mental health to enjoy the moment and plan their future.  Each person that reaches their individual optimum mental health becomes a success that brings smiles, laughter, and just conversation of hard work that brightens their life and future!",

      "biography": "Family Medicine provides care for the entire family from birth, throughout adulthood, and into the last stages of life. My care philosophy is centered around my clinical interests and what I believe are the core values of family medicine which is to practice preventative medicine and help patients make life-style changes to prevent disease. It is also about treating a wide spectrum of diseases and being the first line of contact for the healthcare system. In doing this effectively I hope to gain the trust and establish great relationships with my patients. <br /><br />I grew up in Columbus, OH and went to The University of Toledo College of Medicine and Life Sciences for my Master’s and Medical Degree. I then completed my residency at St. Joseph Mercy Livingston Family Medicine Residency where I was the Academic Chief Resident in my last year of residency before becoming certified by the American Board of Family Medicine. <br /><br />Some interesting things that patients may not know about me would be that I have been skydiving before and I was a placekicker for John Carroll University in College. My interests include playing board games, riding bikes, personal finance, and spending time with family.<br />",

It is also about treating a wide spectrum of diseases and being the first line of contact for the healthcare system. In doing this effectively I hope to gain the trust and establish great relationships with my patients. <br /><br />I grew up in Columbus, OH and went to The University of Toledo College of Medicine and Life Sciences for my Master’s and Medical Degree. I then completed my residency at St. Joseph Mercy Livingston Family Medicine Residency where I was the Academic Chief Resident in my last year of residency before becoming certified by the American Board of Family Medicine. <br /><br />Some interesting things that patients may not know about me would be that I have been skydiving before and I was a placekicker for John Carroll University in College. My interests include playing board games, riding bikes, personal finance, and spending time with family.<br />",

She is passionate about treating patients holistically and providing evidence-based education and treatment techniques to ensure the best care.Clinical interests: Spinning babiesMore about me: Alisha has 13 years of experience in labor and delivery, providing support to patients and their families during labor. She believes in making decisions as a team and is supportive of any decisions that women and their family unit make prior to their arrival to labor and delivery.

My care philosophy is centered around my clinical interests and what I believe are the core values of family medicine which is to practice preventative medicine and help patients make life-style changes to prevent disease. It is also about treating a wide spectrum of diseases and being the first line of contact for the healthcare system. In doing this effectively I hope to gain the trust and establish great relationships with my patients. <br /><br />I grew up in Columbus, OH and went to The University of Toledo College of Medicine and Life Sciences for my Master’s and Medical Degree. I then completed my residency at St. Joseph Mercy Livingston Family Medicine Residency where I was the Academic Chief Resident in my last year of residency before becoming certified by the American Board of Family Medicine. <br /><br />Some interesting things that patients may not know about me would be that I have been skydiving before and I was a placekicker for John Carroll University in College. My interests include playing board games, riding bikes, personal finance, and spending time with family.<br />",

In addition, he often participates in various multi-center research trials designed to improve future treatments for patients.<br /><br />Dr. Phelan is originally from Baltimore, Maryland where most of his early medical education took place. He met his wife while they both were pursuing their medical training in Richmond, Virginia. He and his wife have both been practicing in the Toledo area since 2017.<br />",

Pediatric pulmonary medicine is a specialty that helps children who have problems with breathing. The goal of pulmonary medicine is preventing, diagnosing, and treating diseases of the lung.<br />More about me: Dr. Ruddy is the co-director of the Cystic Fibrosis Center at ProMedica Russell J. Ebeid Children’s Hospital as well as a clinical associate professor of pediatrics at the University of Toledo College of Medicine. Dr. Ruddy graduated from Ohio State University College of Medicine and Public Health. She completed pediatric residency at Akron Children’s Hospital in Akron, Ohio and then completed pediatric pulmonary fellowship at Rainbow Babies &amp; Children’s Hospital in Cleveland, Ohio.  After fellowship, she practiced pediatric pulmonology at Seattle Children’s Hospital in Seattle, Washington until moving back to Ohio in 2012.   <br />Care Philosophy:  Dr. Ruddy's care philosophy is to provide the highest quality care for children by working together as a team with the child and their family. Because each child is unique, it is important to get to know each patient well so that treatment can be based on individual needs as much as possible. She strives to provide thorough evaluation and management and provide detailed education and explanation of the condition. She encourages patients and families to ask questions, and believes that all questions are good questions. She feels that routine follow up visits are very important for many pediatric pulmonary conditions. Her goal is that by working as a team with patients and their families to provide the best care possible, they will be able to lead their lives to the fullest.",

Pediatric pulmonary medicine is a specialty that helps children who have problems with breathing. The goal of pulmonary medicine is preventing, diagnosing, and treating diseases of the lung.<br />More about me: Dr. Ruddy is the co-director of the Cystic Fibrosis Center at ProMedica Russell J. Ebeid Children’s Hospital as well as a clinical associate professor of pediatrics at the University of Toledo College of Medicine. Dr. Ruddy graduated from Ohio State University College of Medicine and Public Health. She completed pediatric residency at Akron Children’s Hospital in Akron, Ohio and then completed pediatric pulmonary fellowship at Rainbow Babies &amp; Children’s Hospital in Cleveland, Ohio.  After fellowship, she practiced pediatric pulmonology at Seattle Children’s Hospital in Seattle, Washington until moving back to Ohio in 2012.   <br />Care Philosophy:  Dr. Ruddy's care philosophy is to provide the highest quality care for children by working together as a team with the child and their family. Because each child is unique, it is important to get to know each patient well so that treatment can be based on individual needs as much as possible. She strives to provide thorough evaluation and management and provide detailed education and explanation of the condition. She encourages patients and families to ask questions, and believes that all questions are good questions. She feels that routine follow up visits are very important for many pediatric pulmonary conditions. Her goal is that by working as a team with patients and their families to provide the best care possible, they will be able to lead their lives to the fullest.",

When we identify a person that has a hereditary predisposition to develop specific cancers, it allows for medical management tailored to that person's individual risks. It may allow for additional treatment options for one’s cancer. It is also information that can be shared with family members as they may benefit from genetic counseling and possible testing. As a Genetic Counselor, we are uniquely trained to help families understand this information and work closely with their providers to ensure they’re receiving the best possible follow-up and screening.  Rachel appreciates many people may be unsure about the genetic counseling and genetic testing process. If you have questions, she encourages you to have an initial consult with a genetic counselor so that we may address your questions and provide education regarding the options of genetic testing. Rachel looks forward to talking with you.<br />",

She wants to get to know her patients so that they both feel comfortable with each other especially when tackling very personal issues. The OB/GYN profession deals with very sensitive parts of the body, and she want her patients to feel respected and comfortable.<br />More about me: Dr. Seo-Patel was raised in New York City, but her training took her all over the country.

When we identify a person that has a hereditary predisposition to develop specific cancers, it allows for medical management tailored to that person's individual risks. It may allow for additional treatment options for one’s cancer. It is also information that can be shared with family members as they may benefit from genetic counseling and possible testing. As a Genetic Counselor, we are uniquely trained to help families understand this information and work closely with their providers to ensure they’re receiving the best possible follow-up and screening.  Rachel appreciates many people may be unsure about the genetic counseling and genetic testing process. If you have questions, she encourages you to have an initial consult with a genetic counselor so that we may address your questions and provide education regarding the options of genetic testing. Rachel looks forward to talking with you.<br />",

Gynecologists help diagnose cervical and ovarian cancers and treat irregularities or painful conditions in people who menstruate.<br />Care philosophy: All patients need to be heard. Dr. Seo-Patel does her very best to work with her patients to provide the care and management plan that best suits their needs and goals. She feels that longitudinal care is important. She wants to get to know her patients so that they both feel comfortable with each other especially when tackling very personal issues. The OB/GYN profession deals with very sensitive parts of the body, and she want her patients to feel respected and comfortable.<br />More about me: Dr. Seo-Patel was raised in New York City, but her training took her all over the country. She believes this provides her a unique and diverse perspective on patient care and also cultural sensitivity.",

When we identify a person that has a hereditary predisposition to develop specific cancers, it allows for medical management tailored to that person’s individual risks. It may allow for additional treatment options for one’s cancer. It is also information that can be shared with family members as they may benefit from genetic counseling and possible testing. As a Genetic Counselor, we are uniquely trained to help families understand this information and work closely with their providers to ensure they’re receiving the best possible follow-up and screening.Many people have questions about the genetic counseling and genetic testing process. If you feel that you would benefit from speaking with a healthcare professional about your personal or family history of cancer, Taylor encourages you to schedule an appointment with a genetic counselor. She looks forward to answering your questions and providing education about genetic testing.<br />",

When we identify a person that has a hereditary predisposition to develop specific cancers, it allows for medical management tailored to that person’s individual risks. It may allow for additional treatment options for one’s cancer. It is also information that can be shared with family members as they may benefit from genetic counseling and possible testing. As a Genetic Counselor, we are uniquely trained to help families understand this information and work closely with their providers to ensure they’re receiving the best possible follow-up and screening.Many people have questions about the genetic counseling and genetic testing process. If you feel that you would benefit from speaking with a healthcare professional about your personal or family history of cancer, Taylor encourages you to schedule an appointment with a genetic counselor. She looks forward to answering your questions and providing education about genetic testing.<br />",

When we identify a person that has a hereditary predisposition to develop specific cancers, it allows for medical management tailored to that person’s individual risks. It may allow for additional treatment options for one’s cancer. It is also information that can be shared with family members as they may benefit from genetic counseling and possible testing. As a Genetic Counselor, we are uniquely trained to help families understand this information and work closely with their providers to ensure they’re receiving the best possible follow-up and screening.Many people have questions about the genetic counseling and genetic testing process. If you feel that you would benefit from speaking with a healthcare professional about your personal or family history of cancer, Taylor encourages you to schedule an appointment with a genetic counselor. She looks forward to answering your questions and providing education about genetic testing.<br />",
