This achievement puts ProMedica Toledo Hospital in the top 1% of hospitals nationwide for overall clinical performance across the most common conditions and procedures.<br />ProMedica continuously strives to build and maintain a culture of safety, clinical excellence and exceptional patient experience. “We are honored to have Toledo Hospital recognized as one of America’s 50 Best Hospitals for the sixth year in a row,” said Dawn Buskey, president of ProMedica acute care. “This recognition underscores our deep commitment to consistently delivering clinical excellence and compassionate care. This is an accomplishment that would not be possible without the dedication of our physicians, nurses and support staff who go above and beyond for our patients every day.”<br />Healthgrades evaluated patient mortality and complication rates for 31 of the most common conditions and procedures at nearly 4,500 hospitals across the country to identify the top-performing hospitals. This year’s analysis revealed significant variation between America’s Best 50 Hospitals and hospitals that did not receive the distinction. In fact, if all hospitals performed similarly to America’s 50 Best, over 150,000 lives could potentially have been saved, according to Healthgrades.* For example: Patients treated for heart failure at one of the 2023 America’s 50 Best Hospitals have, on average, a 22.8% lower risk of dying than if they were treated at a hospital that did not receive the award.*<br />“We’re proud to recognize ProMedica Toledo Hospital as one of America’s 50 Best Hospitals for 2023,” said Brad Bowman, MD, Chief Medical Officer and Head of Data Science at Healthgrades. “As one of America’s 50 Best Hospitals, ProMedica Toledo Hospital consistently delivers better-than-expected outcomes for the patients in their community and is setting a high national standard for clinical excellence.”<br />Visit <a href='https://www.healthgrades.com/quality/americas-best-hospitals'>Healthgrades.com/quality/americas-best-hospitals</a> for an in-depth look at ProMedica Toledo Hospital’s performance and profile to explore the highest quality care in Toledo today.

In partnership with <a href='https://www.recora.com/'>Recora</a>, ProMedica now enables patients to leverage virtual tools to access on-demand cardiac recovery care teams and other resources.<br />The program empowers patients to manage their heart health from home while enabling providers to deliver comprehensive cardiac care and strengthen patient relationships. Recora's Cardiac Recovery Program moves beyond 12 weeks of rehabilitation to deliver comprehensive care management that focuses on a patient's overall health and wellness.<br />'The future of cardiac rehabilitation is moving to a virtual environment, and we know it is imperative we are prepared to deliver this service to our patients,” said Linda Chambers, associate vice president of rehabilitation services at ProMedica. 'By adding a virtual program, we expect to see our patients increase activity in cardiac rehab from the traditional model, which would likely provide tremendous improvements in patient outcomes and increase expected years of living. With the program’s ease-of-use and ability to eliminate barriers to attending sessions, we are excited to see the impact this will make on our community.'<br />Recora currently serves cardiac patients in the U.S. across health systems, health plans and medical groups in urban, suburban and rural communities.<br />'It is a thrill to partner with ProMedica on their journey towards providing virtual cardiac rehab to the people of Ohio and Michigan,' said Recora CEO Abhishek Chandra. “The need for cardiac rehab patients to increase engagement in recovery programs has never been greater. With only 1 in 4 eligible patients starting cardiac rehab, adding a virtual option has been shown to engage more patients overall, greatly reduce hospital readmissions, and significantly increase the number of patients who complete their cardiac recovery program.”<br />Recora's Cardiac Recovery Program has garnered industry-leading results that include:<br />15% hospital readmission rate for Recora patients, versus the national average of 43% across Medicare patients with heart failure at six months.<br />87% Recora cardiac recovery program completion rate, versus the national average of 26%.<br />80% of patients with hypertension markedly improved their blood pressure due to diet and exercise<br />94% of Recora patients adhere to their cardiac medication.<br />80% improvement of distance and strength gains among Recora patients.<br />Patients interested in exploring the option of virtual cardiac rehabilitation should contact their ProMedica physician or sign up to determine eligibility through <a href='https://app.recora.com/patients/signup/promedica'>https://app.recora.com/patients/signup/promedica</a>.<br />"

Randy Oostra made the decision to retire after 25 years with the organization. Over the past six months, Mr. Oostra has worked closely with Mr. Polizzi to prepare him for the chief executive officer role and help ensure a smooth transition in leadership.<br />While Mr. Oostra had discussions about retirement and succession planning with the board prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, he chose to hold off when the unprecedented public health issue arose. Leading the organization through the uncertainty and challenges of the pandemic became his top priority.<br />With the pandemic more under control now, he is moving forward with his retirement plan. His last day at ProMedica will be October 31, 2022.<br />Mr. Oostra began his tenure at ProMedica as vice president at ProMedica Toledo Hospital in 1997. Then, he served as the president of multiple ProMedica hospitals before being promoted to chief operating officer and president of the health system in 2006. He has served as president and chief executive officer since 2009.<br />“Serving ProMedica for the last 25 years has been the highlight of my career,” said ProMedica CEO Randy Oostra. “Over the years, we have had the pleasure of working with so many dedicated caregivers, board members, and community leaders who have inspired our work daily. As part of ProMedica, I’ve also been grateful for the opportunity to connect with many incredible individuals as we have worked to address the social factors that significantly impact health outcomes. Together, we have made meaningful progress in the way health care is delivered. It has been a true honor and privilege to lead ProMedica and serve our communities.”<br />Arturo Polizzi is an experienced executive with a demonstrated history of working in the hospital and health care industry. He is highly skilled in nonprofit organizations, strategy, operations, team building and business development. He started his career in 1998 at ProMedica as an in-house attorney. Over the past 20 years, he has served in various strategic and operational roles at the organization, including associate general counsel, chief human resources officer and president of the metro Toledo ProMedica hospitals. Prior to returning to ProMedica as the chief operating officer in 2020, Mr. Polizzi served as the president and CEO at Christ Hospital Health Network in Cincinnati, Ohio.<br />“I’ve worked closely with Arturo for many years, and I’m confident he will be an exceptional CEO for ProMedica,” said Oostra. “We have been working on a transition plan for some time, and despite the challenges brought about by the pandemic, he is well prepared to continue moving the organization toward long-term financial stability and success.”<br />“On behalf of ProMedica’s board of directors, I want to thank Randy Oostra for his 25 years of commitment to the organization and the remarkable impact he has had on our communities,” said ProMedica Board Chairman Bob LaClair. “Randy has played a pivotal role in helping to transform health care, establishing ProMedica as a leader in addressing the social determinants of health starting more than a decade ago. He has also embraced the anchor Institution philosophy in a way that few other leaders have, resulting in wide-reaching community support that has been a catalyst for many positive changes. We have been inspired by his leadership and commitment to health care and the community, and we wish him all the best in his next chapter.<br />Mr. LaClair continued, “We are pleased to confirm Arturo Polizzi as ProMedica’s next CEO. His extensive, proven leadership at ProMedica and previous health network CEO experience make him a strong asset, and we are confident that Arturo is the ideal choice to further ProMedica’s mission and lead the organization into the future.”<br />"

The investment from the Adrian Dominican Sisters aims to connect participating youth and their families with available community resources, expanding literacy and family education programs. ProMedica will serve as the fiscal manager of the new investment, building upon the pre-existing ProMedica Adrian Ebeid Neighborhood Promise.<br />“We made this investment as part of a congregational commitment to help build resilient communities with local partners that have the capacity to maximize impact in places where our Sisters have had a long-term engagement,” said Patricia Siemen, OP, Prioress of the congregation. “Our Sisters have ministered in the Adrian community since 1879 and it is our hope that this investment, managed by ProMedica and made in collaboration with our other community partners – Boys &amp; Girls Club of Lenawee and All About Adrian Resident Coalition – will enrich the lives of our neighbors on the east side.”<br />Announced earlier this year, the ProMedica Adrian Ebeid Neighborhood Promise is a community-driven initiative for rural investment and community development. Focusing on a core neighborhood with a total population of nearly 11,000 residents, it involves working with residents and stakeholders to close existing gaps in resource availability, accessibility, and attainability and eliminate disparities by investing in new and proven strategies. The initiative intends to help improve the conditions in which residents live, work and play so they are empowered to achieve their highest health potential.<br />Through extensive interviews with community members and demographic research, the Adrian Dominican Sisters’ Adrian Resilient Communities Committee worked with local organizations and neighborhood leaders to develop a comprehensive plan to address specific inequities faced by east Adrian youth and their families. Efforts that will be supported by the Adrian Dominican Sisters’ new investment include:<br />• Developing life skills for youth through the social and emotional learning programs housed at the <a href='https://www.bgclenawee.org/'>Boys &amp; Girls Club of Lenawee</a>.<br />• Connecting youth and their families with community services through a part-time community and family liaison who will work with local mentors to identify additional services needed.<br />• Expanding literacy and family education programs in east Adrian. The All About Adrian Resident Coalition, local public schools, and other organizations will collaborate on the development of programs aimed at continuing and expanding literacy activities.<br />• Creating an Adrian Ebeid Technology Center in east Adrian that will house the Adrian Dominican Sisters Youth Learning Center and computer lab. The center will provide learning opportunities for youth in English language skills, GED preparation and computer skills.<br />Jennifer Hunter, executive director of campus services at the Adrian Dominican Motherhouse and co-chair of the Adrian Resilient Communities Committee, said, “I have no doubt that the Adrian Dominican Sisters’ partnerships and commitment to building resilient communities will enhance the lives of our youth, their families, and our Adrian community, both today and well into the future.”<br />“This investment is an excellent example of anchor institutions aligning their missions to address health disparities and inequities within the community,” said Frank Nagle, director of community impact in Michigan for ProMedica. “We greatly appreciate the Adrian Dominican Sisters Resilient Community Investment to the ProMedica Adrian Ebeid Neighborhood Promise. This catalyzes a partnership and expands upon a program that addresses the social determinants of health to improve the health and well-being of the community.”<br />Cody Waters, chief executive officer of Boys &amp; Girls Club of Lenawee said, “This generous investment allows the Boys &amp; Girls Club of Lenawee the ability to focus our efforts on providing young people with the support necessary to become productive, caring and responsible citizens.”<br />“Creating a better quality of life for a community only happens when everyone is welcomed to the table. When we all are heard and everyone's hands are to the plow does collective effort create a resilient impact,” said DeAngelo Boone, founder of The All About Adrian Resident Coalition.<br />ProMedica’s investment in rural placemaking is based on the success of the ProMedica Ebeid Neighborhood Promise in Toledo, Ohio, in 2016. ProMedica established the initiative to catalyze innovations that help to improve community health and well-being with a focus on social determinants of health. ProMedica will oversee and support the outlined efforts, complementing the existing place-based investment.<br />"

Award<br /><img src='/newsroom/press-releases/easset_upload_file21770_268505_e.jpg' alt='ProMedica Monroe Regional Hospital Receives Q1 MHA Keystone Center Speak-up! Award' /><br />MONROE, Michigan, June 9, 2022 - The Michigan Health and Hospital Association (MHA) Keystone Center honored Beth Bedra, patient safety officer at ProMedica Monroe Regional Hospital, June 9 with the quarterly MHA Keystone Center Speak-up! Award.<br />During the COVID-19 pandemic, changes were made to the main entrance at ProMedica Monroe Regional Hospital to accommodate infection control requirements for patient visitors. However, the revised entrance utilized a revolving door that was not suitable for all visitors and posed a safety risk. Beth personally examined the door, reviewed video footage of how patients and their care partners enter and exit the facility and engaged other staff in identifying solutions. As a result, she led efforts to revise the entrance that accommodates the needs of all visitors at the hospital and ensures the safest walkway possible.<br />“I’m honored to be a recipient of this award and to know that as a team, we’ve been able to improve the patient and visitor experience at ProMedica Monroe Regional Hospital,” said Bedra. “I’m thankful we have a culture where I could speak up and suggest a change that is in the best interest of safety at the hospital.”<br />Launched in March 2016, the MHA Keystone Center Speak-up! Award acknowledges individuals or teams within MHA Keystone Center Patient Safety Organization hospitals who speak up to prevent potential harm to patients or other staff members. The award fosters a culture within healthcare organizations that empowers staff to speak up about the quality or safety of patient care.<br />“We are incredibly grateful to have Beth as part of our team,” said Darrin Arquette, president, ProMedica Monroe Regional Hospital. “Her years of safety experience, in addition to her perceptive observation skills and attention to detail help improve the safety and quality of care for our staff, patients and their care partners on a daily basis.”<br />Additional award finalists for the first quarter of 2022 include:<br />• Jennifer Helman, NP, C.S. Mott Children’s Hospital • Erin Munsel, PharmD, BCCPS, C.S. Mott Children’s Hospital<br />• Jenny Burton, Helen Newberry Joy Hospital<br />“The pandemic has created incredible challenges for hospitals and in many instances, drastically changed the visitor experience,” said MHA CEO Brian Peters. “Beth is a great example that despite the increased stress on healthcare workers, they still display an unwavering commitment to improving safety for all who enter their facilities.”<br />Specifics on the MHA Keystone Center Speak-up! Award, including criteria and a nomination form, are available <a href='https://www.mha.org/About/Awards/Speak-up-Award'>online</a>.<br />"

This represents one of the nation’s largest place-based investments made in a rural community.<br />ProMedica Adrian Ebeid Neighborhood Promise is a community driven initiative for rural investment and community development. It will involve working with residents and stakeholders to close existing gaps in resource availability, accessibility, and attainability and eliminate disparities by investing in new and proven strategies. The initiative is intended to help improve the conditions in which residents live, work, and play to empower them to achieve their highest health potential.<br />ProMedica and the Lenawee Community Foundation recognize that sustainable community change requires long-term engagement, trust building and investment with and by the community. ProMedica Adrian Ebeid Neighborhood Promise will leverage the expertise of residents, businesses, and stakeholders, the unique assets of Lenawee County, and best practices for rural community development from other parts of the country to accelerate health and economic stability for thousands of individuals. Services and programs will be paired with economic learning and research to help ensure solutions will have a positive impact for generations to come.<br />As part of the initiative, the community will address and reduce barriers to health and economic vitality through policy, education, targeted social services programs, and evidence-based solutions while embracing the culture, diversity, arts, community and history of the region. The vision and voice of the community will guide partnerships and investments focused on building and expanding the capacities of neighborhood infrastructure. Partners will co-design a physical space within the neighborhood to be operated by a diverse workforce, which will serve as a gathering place and facilitate job training, financial coaching, and other community services and resources.<br />Through data analysis and extensive conversations with neighborhood leaders and stakeholders, ProMedica and its partners have developed a deeper understanding of the lack of funding, infrastructure, and services in east Adrian. With significant long-term and intentional investment through this initiative, the community will be positioned to build upon the great work started by the All About Adrian Resident Coalition, City of Refuge Ministries International, Habitat for Humanity and several other organizations. The ProMedica Foundation will continue to support the effort through fundraising at the local and national levels to secure resources for the initiative. These generous philanthropic contributions raised from donors and partners will unite the community and make a lasting impact.<br />The initiative will focus on a core neighborhood that has a total population of nearly 11,000 residents. Of the 7,807 households within the core market, nearly half are rental properties and 17% are severely cost-burdened. An average of 28.1% of individuals residing in the core market are living at or below the federal poverty threshold and experience the following conditions:<br />• 18% of adults do not have health insurance; The rate increases to 38% when income is less than $25,000.<br />• 10/100 Housing Stability Index<br />• 17/100 Education Index • 19/100 Health &amp; Well-Being Index<br />• 15/100 Economic Stability Index<br />Data Sources: 2020 Lenawee Community Health Assessment U.S. Census ACS 2015-2019 Enterprise Community Partners 2020<br />ProMedica’s investment in rural placemaking is based on the success of the ProMedica Ebeid Neighborhood Promise in Toledo, Ohio, in 2016. ProMedica established the initiative to catalyze innovations that help to improve community health and well-being with a focus on social determinants of health. These efforts are centered around community voice, data-based decision making, and a focus on whole person health.<br />"

The campaign, appropriately titled ‘Share the Love’, will run from Valentine’s Day through the end of February.<br />Early on during the COVID-19 pandemic, there was an outpouring of public support for health care workers that included gestures like meal donations, sign displays and sidewalk chalk messages. Those gestures were greatly appreciated, especially as caregivers dealt with much uncertainty about the new disease. But as the pandemic has lingered, those gestures waned. Yet, with repeated surges, health care workers across the industry have continued to face some of the greatest challenges in their careers.<br />Occupational strain and mental stress are a reality of an extended pandemic. But, now that we are on the downside of the largest surge to date, ProMedica Foundation sees an opportunity for the community to help uplift weary health care workers.<br />The ‘Share the Love’ fundraising campaign enables community members to donate any amount and no amount is too small. The campaign also offers community members the opportunity to provide a special message of encouragement to health care workers. The messages will be printed on green paper hearts and displayed in employee areas at ProMedica health care facilities across northwest Ohio and southeast Michigan.<br />The campaign will also include Match Mondays. That means ProMedica Foundation will match every donation that comes in on the Mondays throughout the campaign up to $5000.00. Those dates include February 14, 21 and 28.<br />All funds raised through the campaign will go directly toward providing uplifting experiences for ProMedica caregivers at work. The experiences will be at the discretion of team leaders to help ensure they are tailored to individual teams and environments. Experiences could include things like special catered meals, chair massage sessions, aromatherapy, fun team-building activities and more.<br />To donate to the ‘Share the Love’ fundraising campaign and offer a message of encouragement for ProMedica caregivers, text “Love” to 36413. <br />"

In addition to the U.S. Women’s Open presenting sponsorship, as part of the long-term relationship, ProMedica becomes the official health and well-being partner of the USGA.<br />The U.S. Women’s Open has led the way for more than 75 years and is already considered the world’s premier women’s golf championship. To retain and enhance its standing, most immediately and beginning with the 2022 championship that will be conducted June 2-5 at Pine Needles Lodge &amp; Golf Club in Southern Pines, N.C., the purse will nearly double, increasing from $5.5 million to $10 million, the highest in women’s golf and among the leaders in all of women’s sports. The USGA also announced a commitment to raise the Women’s Open purse to $11 million and then $12 million over the next five years.<br />“The USGA prides itself on conducting championships that not only provide an incredible stage for the athletes, but also give younger players something to dream about,” said Mike Whan, CEO of the USGA. “For more than 75 years, the U.S. Women’s Open has been the one that every little girl, in every country around the world, has dreamed of winning. This partnership with ProMedica allows us to substantially grow the championship in every way, from its purpose, to its purse, to the places that host the event. While I’m incredibly proud of what we are announcing today, I know this is just the beginning, as together with ProMedica, we’ll push to change the game and what it means to young women worldwide in order to reach new heights every year.”<br />Key to the partnership is a joint commitment by the organizations to highlight the importance of addressing health inequities across the United States, which will include sharing the personal stories of golfers and USGA competitors nationwide who have used golf as a means to a healthier lifestyle.<br />ProMedica will also utilize the global stage the U.S. Women’s Open provides to generate charitable dollars for its <a href='https://www.promedica.org/impact-fund/' target='_blank'>ProMedica Impact Fund</a>, which will become the official charity of the U.S. Women’s Open. The ProMedica Impact Fund is committed to raising more than $1 billion over eight years to strategically invest in grants, impact investments, and research and learning activities, all designed to improve individual and community health. The partners will conduct fundraising to support social determinants of health (SDOH) initiatives and other programs in championship communities.<br />“With this unprecedented partnership, both organizations are breaking new ground,” said Randy Oostra, ProMedica president and CEO. “ProMedica will benefit from taking its work in social determinants of health onto a national stage, while the USGA will benefit from the opportunity to embrace a not-for-profit organization whose mission and support will elevate its signature women’s event.”<br />“You simply cannot talk about improving the health and well-being of all individuals without talking about the disproportionate impact of social determinants of health on women. The U.S. Women’s Open is a perfect platform for bringing this message to a much broader audience,” said Oostra.<br />As a piece of the partnership, ProMedica will provide on-site medical services at several USGA championships, as well as deliver health and well-being experiences for fans on-site and throughout host communities.<br />The USGA today also named five additional U.S. Women’s Open host sites: The Riviera Country Club in Pacific Palisades, Calif. (2026); Inverness Club in Toledo, Ohio (2027); Pinehurst Resort &amp; Country Club in Village of Pinehurst, N.C. (2029); Interlachen Country Club in Edina, Minn. (2030); and Oakland Hills Country Club in Bloomfield Hills, Mich. (2031 and 2042).

Inverness was founded in 1903 and its current course was designed by Donald Ross in 1916. Among its historic moments, Inverness is where four-time champion Bob Jones first competed in a U.S. Open, and it most recently hosted the 2019 U.S. Junior Amateur and the 2021 Solheim Cup. The club will also host the 2029 U.S. Amateur.

This will be the second U.S. Women’s Open at Pinehurst, with Michelle Wie West earning her first major championship there in 2014. Pinehurst, which was named the Association’s first anchor site in September 2020, has hosted 13 USGA championships, and is set to host five additional U.S. Opens over the next 25 years.<br /><a href='https://mediacenter.usga.org/download/USGA+Championships+at+Interlachen.pdf' target='_blank'>Interlachen</a> will host its second U.S. Women’s Open and sixth USGA championship overall. The 2030 U.S. Women’s Open will be played on the 100th anniversary of Bob Jones’s U.S. Open victory at Interlachen, where his victory set the stage for Jones to secure the Grand Slam later in 1930 at Merion. The club has also hosted the 1935 U.S. Women’s Amateur, the 1986 U.S. Senior Amateur, the 1993 Walker Cup and the 2008 U.S. Women’s Open, won by Inbee Park. Interlachen has retained Andrew Green to do restorative work to its Donald Ross design beginning in 2022.<br /><a href='https://mediacenter.usga.org/download/USGA+Championships+at+Oakland+Hills.pdf' target='_blank'>Oakland Hills</a> will host its 12th USGA championship and first U.S. Women’s Open. It will become the fifth club to have hosted a U.S. Open, U.S. Women’s Open, U.S. Amateur and U.S. Women’s Amateur, with Pebble Beach set to do so in 2023. The South Course, which has hosted six U.S. Opens, was designed by Donald Ross and opened in 1918. It was renovated by Robert Trent Jones (1950), Rees Jones (2006) and Gil Hanse (2021).<br />The U.S. Women’s Open is one of 15 national championships conducted annually by the USGA. The championship began in 1946 and its winners include Babe Didrikson Zaharias, Betsy Rawls, Mickey Wright, Hollis Stacy, Amy Alcott, Meg Mallon, Annika Sorenstam, Se Ri Pak, Juli Inkster, Cristie Kerr, Paula Creamer, Inbee Park and Michelle Wie West. Showcasing the world’s best players on the greatest stage in the game, the U.S. Women’s Open welcomes the global golf community to participate in and experience America’s national championship.<br />About the USGA<br /> The USGA is a nonprofit organization that celebrates, serves and advances the game of golf.

This is the fifth consecutive year Mr. Oostra has received national recognition from Modern Healthcare.<br />This prestigious recognition program acknowledges and honors individuals deemed by their peers and the senior editors of Modern Healthcare to be the most influential in the industry in terms of leadership and impact. Entries for the recognition are accepted from all sectors of the health care industry for senior-level executives, high-level government administrators and executives, elected officials, academics and thought leaders.<br />According to Modern Healthcare, 'Last year's complexity is reflected in our 2021 Most Influential People in Healthcare honorees. The year was dominated with vaccines that promised a return to normal. But that treatment faced ire and rejection from some, creating divisions in communities and even the health care workforce,” said Modern Healthcare Editor Aurora Aguilar. “Meanwhile, the financial sector threw around its weight in health care, causing some pushback from the industry and regulators who say private equity and venture capital's goals conflict with health care's mission. Still, there's no denying that new players affected the business of health care in 2021.'<br />“With all of the extraordinary and sustained demands we have experienced during the ongoing pandemic, it is an incredible honor for ProMedica to be recognized by Modern Healthcare once again,” said Randy Oostra, president and CEO, ProMedica. “Throughout 2021, ProMedica team members have continued to overcome challenges and put the needs of others before their own, working tirelessly to care for and support our patients, residents, members and their families. We continue to be awe-inspired by and extremely grateful for their dedication, resilience and sacrifice.”<br />The complete ranking can be found in this week’s issue of Modern Healthcare magazine, and a feature article and profiles of the winners are available <a href='https://www.modernhealthcare.com/awards/100-most-influential-people-healthcare-2021?adobe_mc=MCMID%3D12577483699935753248229041915226279392%7CMCAID%3D2E364A708507E81D-6000011B4000148F%7CMCORGID%3D138FFF2554E6E7220A4C98C6%2540AdobeOrg%7CTS%3D1640009274'>here</a>.<br />"

The agreement will also transfer the management of operations of Emory’s skilled nursing facility, Budd Terrace at Wesley Woods, to ProMedica. The management agreement will become effective Sept. 1, 2021.<br />The joint venture demonstrates how health systems and post-hospital and rehabilitative care experts with advanced knowledge of the health care continuum can collaborate to develop innovative care solutions. By leveraging their respective skills and expertise, ProMedica, the nation’s largest not-for-profit post-hospital care provider, and Emory Healthcare, a renowned health care and academic institution, are uniquely positioned to improve health care connectivity and access to resources that help patients transition between hospital and home in the Atlanta area. Beginning Sept. 1, ProMedica will manage the day-to-day operations at Budd Terrace, while Emory will be involved with quality performance and strategic planning initiatives.<br />“We are pleased to collaborate with ProMedica as we enhance and expand skilled nursing and rehabilitative services for those who need our care,” says Jonathan S. Lewin, MD, CEO of Emory Healthcare. “Finding an organization that aligns with our values and missions to improve the health of the communities we serve was critical as we move forward.”<br />“ProMedica has a strong skilled nursing care presence in Atlanta, and we are excited to partner with another forward-thinking health care organization to provide the community with enhanced post-hospital services,” says Randy Oostra, FACHE, ProMedica’s president and chief executive officer. “Working with Emory Healthcare to bring innovative approaches to care that combine high tech with high touch, we seek to enhance the patient experience and improve health outcomes. Together, we will offer a truly unique health care alternative in our community for those recovering from illness, injury or surgery.”<br />ProMedica is currently looking for locations in metro Atlanta to build the two new facilities, which are expected to take two years to build once regulatory approval is received. The state-of-the-art facilities will feature private rooms and baths and innovative therapy areas focused on getting patients safely back into the community. The centers will also have attractive social and multi-purpose areas, specialized dining services and beauty and barber services. Medically complex and intensive rehabilitation services supervised by specialty physicians, nurse practitioners and medical directors will be offered seven days a week to short-term patients transitioning from hospital to home, in addition to 24-hour skilled nursing care.<br />When the management agreement takes effect on Sept. 1, Emory Healthcare employees working at Budd Terrace will remain Emory Healthcare employees, however they will be supervised by ProMedica. Once the newly built centers are open in the near future, employees and patients will transition and the current Budd Terrace facility will be closed.<br />A key provision of the joint venture is forming a quality joint operating committee with clinical staff to focus on reducing preventable re-hospitalizations, creating a seamless patient experience, improving patient satisfaction and outcomes and engaging in future strategic planning. Both Emory Healthcare and ProMedica executives will be a part of the joint operating committee.<br />"

We reached out to Susan Vanisacker, director of community relations and the La-Z-Boy Foundation, who sits on a ProMedica Patient Experience Board Focus group. We knew she was a part of the La-Z-Boy team and hoped she could point us in the right direction,” said Meyer, “When approached, she was eager to see how she could help.”<br />“The La-Z-Boy philosophy is to bring quality and comfort to people,” said Vanisacker. “We immediately saw the need for comfort in frontline caregivers, not just during the pandemic, but all the time. A moment of relaxation can make a world of difference.”<br />Thanks to the generous donation, ten ProMedica acute care facilities now have a relaxation room with a La-Z-Boy massage recliner. The ProMedica Foundation provided special chair coverings to uphold all safety protocols.<br />"

We want our patients to have the best tools possible to improve their health and well-being and remove any barriers of accessibility.”<br />Additionally, the devices assist patients who have other medical issues preventing them from being able to communicate verbally. “For example, a patient with a facial injury, a sports injury, or stroke, may be unable to speak. While they may not be deaf, they still need a way to communicate effectively,” said Hegedus.<br />“The devices are also of great assistance with COVID-19 patients who are on ventilators and not able to communicate verbally. Doctors and nurses are able to utilize the devices to facilitate real-time conversations with their patients instead of using dry erase boards,” said Hegedus.<br />The devices do not require Wi-Fi or internet connection and work on their own secure system. Designed with a low frequency, wireless signal, the devices will not affect other medical devices in use within the facility. The devices meets all Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) compliance requirements and provide non-stop, one-on-one communication between deaf and hearing people.<br />ProMedica is the only health system in northwest Ohio that has implemented these devices, which are currently at the following ProMedica hospitals: Toledo, Flower, Coldwater Regional, Monroe Regional, Charles and Virginia Hickman, Defiance Regional, Memorial and Fostoria Community. The ProMedica Toledo Hospital Audiology department and the Interpreter and Language Access Services office also have the devices, and there are plans to make them available at more ProMedica locations.<br />"

    "content": "<br />ProMedica Announces Partnership with Intuitive Health Press Release<br />ProMedica Announces Partnership with Intuitive Health<br /><img src='/assets/images/news/press-releases/hands.jpg' alt='ProMedica Announces Partnership with Intuitive Health' /><br />TOLEDO, Ohio, June 29, 2021 – ProMedica has partnered with Dallas-based Intuitive Health to bring the first hybrid emergency room and urgent care clinic to support the growing needs of residents and businesses in northwest Ohio.<br />Since 2008, Intuitive Health has partnered with established health systems nationwide to build, operate, launch and retain health care facilities that provide urgent care and emergency room services under one roof. The dual emergency and urgent care facilities eliminate the need for patients to self-diagnose the severity of their health concerns before selecting the most appropriate medical center for care. The new patient-centered model is designed to simplify the way patients access immediate, appropriate care while also lowering out-of-pocket costs.<br />“ProMedica is excited to partner with Intuitive Health to bring the hometown Five-Star services of ProMedica Toledo Hospital closer to home for patients who live or work in the Toledo suburb, Maumee, and the surrounding communities,” said Dawn Buskey, ProMedica president of acute care. “Intuitive Health pioneered the freestanding Emergency Center and Urgent Care model in 2008. Since then, the company has partnered with leading health care systems across the nation to establish and operate freestanding Emergency Center and Urgent Care facilities in 10 major U.S. markets.”<br />ProMedica Toledo Hospital Emergency and Urgent Care will have a full-service ER open 24 hours a day and an urgent care open 7 a.m. to 9 p.m. seven days a week. Each facility is equipped with on-site lab equipment, a radiology suite with X-ray and multi-slice CT scanners, and staffed with board-certified, ER-licensed physicians. The ER physician examines each patient and determines if the appropriate care is emergent or urgent care. Patients are billed accordingly, only paying for the level of care they need, which eliminates unnecessary emergency room visits.<br />“Health care is changing, and consumers are demanding better service with an emphasis on convenience, safety and value. Our combined Emergency and Urgent Care model provides the convenience and efficiency of a top retailer while delivering the highest level of clinical care and customer service that patients demand. Patients no longer need to plan around their provider's schedule, and they no longer need to self-triage whether they need emergency or urgent care. Instead, they can come to our facility any time of day and receive the right level of care without having to pay more than is appropriate,' said Thom Herrmann, CEO of Intuitive Health. “Over 70% of our patients are treated and billed at the urgent care level.”<br />The 11,000 square-foot facility is designed to be warm and welcoming with an area designed just for children. Patients can receive care without an appointment, but they have the option to pre-register online if they prefer and can do so. Before treatment even begins, patients are informed whether they will be treated as an urgent care patient or as an emergency room patient, for which additional consent is needed.<br />For more information about ProMedica, visit <a href='http://www.promedica.org'>promedica.org</a>.<br />For more information about Intuitive Health, visit <a href='https://www.iheruc.com/'>iheruc.com</a>.<br />"

Ebeid Children’s Hospital</a> have earned re-verification of each respective trauma level association from the <a href='https://www.facs.org/quality-programs/trauma/tqp/center-programs/vrc'>Verification Review Committee</a> (VRC), an ad hoc committee of the Committee of Trauma of the American College of Surgeons (ACS). Toledo Hospital remains verified as a Level I adult trauma center and has been for over two decades. Ebeid Children’s was re-verified as a Level II pediatric trauma center, a status it has upheld since 2014.<br />A team of reviewers, who have previous experience in the field of trauma, conducted on-site reviews of those centers participating in the re-verification process. Using the current Resources for the Optimal Care of the Injured Patient manual as a guideline, the team evaluated the centers’ capability to provide hospital resources necessary for trauma care as well as the entire spectrum of care to address the needs of all injured patients. This includes the pre-hospital phase through any necessary rehabilitation.<br />“We are proud to announce that ProMedica Toledo Hospital has again achieved Level I Trauma verification and has maintained this status since 1999. ProMedica Russell J. Ebeid Children’s Hospital also remains a leader in trauma care re-verified as a Level II pediatric trauma center,” said Dawn Buskey, president of ProMedica acute care. “We are committed to serving our community and providing the highest level of trauma care to critically ill or injured patients each and every day.”<br />The full spectrum trauma team at Toledo Hospital and Ebeid Children’s includes: adult board-certified critical care surgeons, critical care specialists, pediatric surgeons, trauma adult advanced practice providers, pediatric trauma advanced practice providers, who are specialized in trauma care. Additionally, ProMedica’s trauma services encompass a wide variety of subspecialties, including orthopaedic surgery, neurosurgery, anesthesia, radiology, emergency medicine, plastic surgery, and several additional surgical consulting services on a case-by-case basis, providing a multidisciplinary care approach.<br /> <br />"

The report states, “The need to attract students from underrepresented groups in nursing – specifically men and individuals from African American, Hispanic, Asian, American Indian, and Alaskan native backgrounds - is a high priority for the nursing profession.”<br />The ProMedica Ebeid Neighborhood Promise Diversity in Nursing Scholarship program will create expanded postsecondary opportunities for senior students and graduates of high schools in the northwest Ohio and southeast Michigan region to attend a two-year institution nearby. It will also add to the spectrum of opportunities for individuals graduating from the Ebeid Neighborhood Promise (ENP) State Tested Nursing Assistant (STNA) program.<br />“We are thrilled to add this scholarship to the continuum of solutions currently being offered through ProMedica,” said Deana Sievert, DNP, RN, EPB-C, ProMedica chief nursing officer. “ProMedica recognizes the inequities and continues to drive real resources to support opportunities for all people in our region.”<br />The ENP Diversity in Nursing Scholarship will be applied after eligible state and federal financial aid is distributed. Eligible schools include Owens Community College, Northwest State Community College, Terra State Community College, Monroe Community College and Hondros College of Nursing.<br />ProMedica is seeking students to apply for the diversity in nursing scholarship, and the application will be available June 1, 2021. Students must agree to a post-graduation, full-time work commitment for three years within ProMedica and maintaining a relationship with an assigned mentor.<br />“We are excited to support this effort and especially pleased with the thoughtful criteria design,” said Sievert. “This opportunity is designed to draw forward and create opportunities for the great talent that already exists in our region, and also ensure that talent has the support and resources they need to be successful.”<br /><a href='/social-determinants-of-health/ebeid-neighborhood-promise/diversity-in-nursing-scholarship'>Learn more about the scholarship program</a><br />"

This recognition means that at least 93 percent of patients at Fostoria Community Hospital responded that 'nurses always communicated well.'<br />“The team of nurses at Fostoria Community Hospital are extremely deserving of this recognition,” said Jodi Rucker, CNO/VP of Patient Care Services, Fostoria Community Hospital. “Communication is a key component in nursing, and the HCAHPS surveys show how our nurses have excelled in that area.”<br />The figures are from CMS' Hospital Compare website and represent HCAHPS scores collected from Jan. 1, 2019, through Dec. 31, 2019, the most recent data available.

The sculpture, designed by Jeremy Link and Douglas Kampfer, will be titled: Breathe<br /> <br />Breathe will pay tribute to all front-line health care workers, who fought and sacrificed to protect the public during an unprecedented pandemic. “In the face of uncertainty and challenges over the past year, health care professionals, support staff and many others across our region stepped up in a major way,” said Randy Oostra, president and CEO of ProMedica. “As we look to a brighter future beyond the pandemic, we need to heal while continuing to embrace the important lessons learned. Since art plays a powerful role in healing, we are excited to partner on a COVID-19 remembrance sculpture for our community.”<br /> <br />The sculpture will offer a place of remembrance for the lives lost to COVID-19 and all of those deeply affected by the pandemic. For the general public, the sculpture will provide a point of reflection with symbolism that represents the strong connection to breath, the changes in human group interactions, the need for proper social distancing, and the power of people working together during the pandemic.<br /> <br />Since the Metroparks offered extraordinary refuge to many throughout the pandemic, it is fitting that Breathe continues that important connection.<br /> <br />“At times during the last year, Metroparks were among the few places we could safely go to relax and unwind,” said Dave Zenk, executive director of Metroparks Toledo. “We talk about the importance of the outdoors for our mental and physical well-being, but it was never more apparent than it was in 2020, when we saw a record 6 million visits to our 19 Metroparks.”<br /> <br />The sizable circular sculpture (proposed to be approximately 48’ across) is expected to be a permanent art installation in a Metroparks Toledo area along the banks of the Maumee River near downtown. A more specific location will be confirmed at a later date.<br /> <br />Installation of the Breathe sculpture is expected to start later in 2021.<br /> <br />'Toledo has a rich legacy of public art, founding the first program in Ohio back in 1977. We are honored to work with our partners at ProMedica and the Metroparks to commission local artists to create a public work of art honoring those who have provided care through the pandemic and make a space for commemoration and reflection of this time for generations to come,' said Marc Folk, President and CEO of The Arts Commission.<br />"

The TPE awards represent Ohio, Indiana, and West Virginia's highest honor for performance excellence through innovation, results, and visionary leadership using the Baldridge Excellence Framework.<br />By working within the Baldridge Excellence Framework set forth by TPE, ProMedica has been able to demonstrate a greater focus on patients, residents and members, along with improved process management, innovation, work systems, and organization-wide results. TPE acknowledged that organizations demonstrating such improvements typically experience lower costs, improved productivity, and increases in both employee and customer satisfaction.<br />TPE recognized ProMedica for its evolution into an integrated health and well-being organization that spans the continuum of health care, stating, “In keeping with its vision to create a transformational health and well-being model that integrates the physical and social needs of people at every stage of their life, ProMedica is a national pioneer and leader in social determinants of health.”<br />As part of the award evaluation process, TPE reviewed all aspects of ProMedica, including the organization’s provider and clinical services, senior care services and Paramount health and dental insurance divisions. To qualify for this award, ProMedica was rigorously evaluated by an independent board of examiners in seven areas defined by the Baldridge Excellence Framework: leadership; strategy; customers; measurement, analysis, and knowledge management; workforce; operations; and results.<br />“ProMedica has been on a multi-year journey with TPE and the Baldridge Excellence Framework, receiving top recognition for individual hospitals and gold-level recognition for the system the past two years,” said Randy Oostra, president and CEO of ProMedica. “We are extremely honored to receive the highest-level regional recognition for our entire system this year, especially considering the added challenges presented by the pandemic. This recognition is the direct result of our employees’ strong connection to our mission, vision and values and their commitment to continual process improvement. We are grateful for TPE’s recognition of our decade-long commitment and national leadership in addressing the social determinants of health. We look forward to continuing our journey of excellence.”<br />ProMedica is slated to be formally honored at an awards banquet later this year and recognized during TPE's annual Quest for Success virtual conference to be held September 13-14, 2021.<br />As the recipient of TPE’s highest-level award, ProMedica will be invited to apply for the national Baldridge award.<br />"

The Leapfrog Group is an independent national watchdog organization committed to health care quality and safety. The Leapfrog Hospital Safety Grade assigns an “A,” “B,” “C,” “D,” or “F” grade to all general hospitals across the country and is updated every six months. It is the only hospital ratings program based exclusively on hospitals’ prevention of medical errors and other harms to patients in their care.                         <br />“It’s been a difficult year to be in health care, but at ProMedica Memorial Hospital, one thing that has never wavered is our dedication to safety,” said Deana Sievert, president of ProMedica Memorial Hospital. “With yet another ‘A’ safety grade from the Leapfrog Group, members of the community can be reassured that Memorial Hospital consistently exceeds safety practices and procedures.”<br />“An ‘A’ safety grade is an elite designation that your community should be proud of,” said Leah Binder, president and CEO of The Leapfrog Group. “The past year has been extraordinarily difficult for hospitals, but Memorial Hospital shows us it is possible to keep a laser focus on patients and their safety, no matter what it takes.”<br />Developed under the guidance of a <a href='http://www.leapfroggroup.org/about/expert-panelists'>national Expert Panel</a>, the Leapfrog Hospital Safety Grade uses up to 27 measures of publicly available hospital safety data to assign grades to more than 2,700 U.S. acute-care hospitals twice per year. The Hospital Safety Grade’s methodology is peer-reviewed and fully transparent, and the results are free to the public.<br />Memorial Hospital was awarded an “A” grade today when Leapfrog updated grades for spring 2021.

As a member of the collaborative, ProMedica participated in data collection for the CovidSurg Week study by reviewing every surgery during one specific week in October, determining whether or not the patients had ever had COVID-19 and documenting their surgical outcomes. Due to the amount of data collection at ProMedica and the short timeframe, two teams of surgeons, residents, nurses, students, and researchers were established to effectively collect and submit the data.<br />The COVIDSurg Collaborative, led by an international team of researchers, published its findings after studying data for 141,582 patients from across 1,667 hospitals in 116 countries -including Australia, Brazil, China, India, United Arab Emirates, United Kingdom and the United States.<br />The study determined that patients waiting for elective surgery should get COVID-19 vaccines ahead of the general population – potentially helping to avoid thousands of post-operative deaths linked to the virus.<br />“We have shown that surgical patients have additional risks with regard to COVID-19. As the global rollout of vaccinations continues, the CovidSurg Collaborative model suggests that surgical patients should be advised to complete the vaccination process prior to a medical procedure,” said Tahir Jamil, MD, ProMedica Physicians General Surgery.<br />The study found that between 0.6% and 1.6% of patients develop COVID-19 infection after elective surgery. Patients who develop COVID-19 infection are significantly at risk of death in the 30 days following surgery. A patient 70 years and over undergoing cancer surgery would usually have a 2.8% mortality rate, this increases to 18.6% if they develop a COVID-19 infection.<br />The study also found that vaccination is likely to decrease postoperative pulmonary complications, which is key in reducing intensive care use and overall health care costs.<br />As a result of the study, ProMedica encourages surgical patients to get vaccinated prior to elective surgery, with the recommendation that COVID-19 vaccine administration be finalized at least five days prior to surgery. ProMedica continues to test all patients for COVID-19 prior to surgery.<br />"

To achieve voluntary NAPBC accreditation, ProMedica Cancer Institute demonstrated compliance with the 28 NAPBC standards that address leadership, clinical services, research, community outreach, professional education, and quality improvement for patients.<br />As a NAPBC-accredited center, ProMedica Cancer Institute is committed to maintaining levels of excellence in the delivery of comprehensive, patient-centered, multidisciplinary care resulting in high-quality care for patients with breast disease. Patients can be confident their breast care team includes health care professionals from various disciplines who are committed to working together to provide the best care available through their entire course of treatment.<br />Patients receiving care at an NAPBC-accredited center also have access to information on clinical trials and new treatment options, genetic counseling, and patient-centered services, including psychosocial support, rehabilitation services, dietary counseling, complementary therapies and survivorship care.<br />“ProMedica Cancer Institute is committed to quality cancer care close to home. As the largest provider of cancer care in our region, ProMedica demonstrates this commitment not only through the care it provides, but also in the accreditations it maintains to demonstrate our passion for quality that ultimately benefits our patients,” said Ann Kujawa, vice president, ProMedica Cancer Institute.<br />In addition to the NAPBC Accreditation, ProMedica maintains accreditation through the American College of Radiology for all five of its radiation therapy centers. It earned the Outstanding Achievement Award through the American College of Surgeons Commission on Cancer for three consecutive 3-year cycles. Its medical oncology program demonstrates a commitment of quality through accreditation by the Quality Oncology Practice Initiative (QOPI), and its pediatric cancer center is the only member in the region of the Children’s Oncology Group, which is the largest organization dedicated exclusively to pediatric cancer research.<br />Kujawa said, “ProMedica Cancer Institute can proudly proclaim that we are the only cancer center in the region that maintains these five accreditations. We do this because we are passionate about making sure our patients receive consistent, high-quality care that leads to the best health outcomes.”<br />"

'Code Lavender is portable, scalable, and exactly the intervention that chaplains can make at a time when so many health care staff are pushed to the absolute limit. This project could not have come at a better time.'<br />A Code Lavender is an intervention that may be called by a nurse administrator, manager of any department, employee assistance program (EAP) counselor or chaplain. It is enacted to provide direct person-to-person support to the staff when the need arises. A Code Lavender may be called when staff members’ ability to function is being affected due to a stressful event or a series of stressful events.<br />The Code Lavender: Supporting Our Front-Line Family project includes three primary objectives:<br />Create a Code Lavender support program to be used in five local hospitals with staff chaplains, and in the future with Air/Mobile and Market on the Green locations.<br />Expand the chaplains’ knowledge through training in stress management, compassion fatigue and suicide prevention.<br />Develop a care curriculum for staff in stress management, empathy training and suicide prevention, including self-care, team care and spiritual care.<br />“A Code Lavender is meant to assist staff when struggling with the ambiguity of situations, providing information and de-stressing items and allowing for the Code Lavender staff to encourage affected staff to seek appropriate levels of support,” said Grieb.<br />Once a Code Lavender is called, the Emergency Assistance Program (EAP) and Code Lavender team set up a response within two to twelve hours. The chaplain brings a Code Lavender cart to the department. A small gathering takes place and then the Code Lavender team individually confers with each department member.<br />A Code Lavender cart is equipped with items such as:<br />Informational flyers related to suicide prevention and self-care<br />EAP contact information for counseling services<br />Stress management items, such as aromatherapy supplies, stress balls, colored pencils and coloring pages<br />Soon, iPads will be available to use for music therapy, meditation and other audio tools for decompressing<br />Prayer cards<br />The Code Lavender team revisits the department one week after the Code Lavender is called to assess the needs for additional support.<br />"

The partnership is ProMedica’s first investment from its Impact Fund, announced in 2020 as a bold commitment to raise $1B to transform how health care is defined, delivered, and funded while demonstrating the connection between social needs interventions and health outcomes and cost.<br />“We know that poor housing conditions lead to health issues, higher health care costs, lower school performance and reduced productivity, “ said Kate Sommerfeld, president of the ProMedica National Social Determinants of Health Institute. “Social needs like access to safe and affordable housing also disproportionally impact communities of color. We are excited to work with the GHHI team to improve the health and safety of homes with our inaugural ProMedica Impact Fund investment.”<br />The first phase of the partnership with ProMedica will include a deep analysis of existing housing conditions and local organizational capacity in several cities where ProMedica has a presence. ProMedica and GHHI will engage local partners to identify households, make home modifications and provide additional supports to families to improve their overall well-being.<br />“Investing in housing is the most tangible way to address the health and economic opportunity gaps in under-resourced communities,” said Ruth Ann Norton, president and CEO of the Green &amp; Healthy Homes Initiative. “It is a privilege to partner with ProMedica, a health care organization that shares GHHI’s commitment to engaging communities in the solutions that will improve health, economic and educational outcomes for children and families in measurable and meaningful ways.”<br />Learn more about how ProMedica is addressing the <a href='https://www.promedica.org/social-determinants-of-health/'>Social Determinants of Health</a>.<br />"

Ebeid Children’s Hospital’s</a> Injury Prevention and Community Outreach Department is taking the opportunity to educate the community in hopes of decreasing the number of teen distracted driving crashes in Lucas County. This will be done through a number of outlets.<br /> Teen drivers are already at a disadvantage when it comes to car crashes due to a lack of experience behind the wheel. Adding any distraction, especially a cell phone, causes them to be even more likely to crash. According to the <a href='https://www.nhtsa.gov/road-safety/teen-driving'>National Highway Traffic Safety Administration</a>, the likelihood of a teen crashing while driving increases six times when dialing a phone number and 23 times if they choose to text.<br /> Teenagers and their parents can get information on distracted driving throughout the month on the Rollin’ Smart <a href='https://www.facebook.com/Rollin-Smart-108879684594464'>Facebook</a> and <a href='https://www.instagram.com/rollinsmart419/'>Instagram</a> accounts. Starting April 4, there will be giveaways done each Sunday on the accounts. Those who comment on the distracted driving posts will be put in a drawing to win prizes donated by local businesses. One comment equals one entry, so the more comments, the more likely they are to win. <br /> On April 12, teenagers can visit a participating Dunkin’ location to receive a free donut. They must show their student ID to participate. Participating locations include: <br /> <br />2709 Central Ave, Toledo, OH 43606<br />5649 W Alexis Rd, Sylvania, OH 43560<br />2474 Navarre Avenue, Oregon, OH 43616<br /> There will be two interactive booths at the Franklin Park Mall, April 10, and The Shops at Fallen Timbers, April 24. Members from the ProMedica Ebeid Children’s Hospital Injury Prevention and Community Outreach Department will distribute informational brochures and have a distracted driving simulator for teens to utilize. Prizes and giveaways will also be available to teens by answering questions that are related to distracted driving.  Note: COVID-19 safety protocols will be required to attend the booths. Best judgment is encouraged if parents or their children are feeling ill. Those who have COVID-19 symptoms and/or a known exposure to someone who tested positive for the virus are strongly advised not to attend.<br /> “Ensuring the safety of the communities we serve has always been of the utmost importance to ProMedica,” said Taylor Meehan, ProMedica Russell J. Ebeid Children’s Hospital Injury Prevention Specialist. “We are looking forward to educating new drivers and their parents on safe driving habits.” <br /> This work is funded either in whole or in part by a grant awarded by the Ohio Department of Health as a sub-award of a grant issued by Preventative Health and Health Services Block Grant under the Injury Prevention Program by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, grant award number 1 NB01OT009358-01-00 and the State Farm Teen and Distracted Driving grant the department was awarded.<br />"

The observance honors the nation’s doctors, who have dedicated themselves to service by helping to save lives and ensure the good health of each patient, especially during the recent pandemic.<br />“This year, there aren’t adequate ways to say thank you. We know that many of our providers treated patients with an illness the world had not encountered. With gratitude and admiration, we thank our physicians for stepping up in such incredible and awe-inspiring ways,” said Angela Brandt, president, ProMedica Physicians Group.<br />ProMedica Physicians serve patients in northwest Ohio and southeast Michigan, covering more than 55 specialties, which include cancer, heart care, neurosciences, orthopaedics and women’s services.<br />“Do you know what our physicians want for the community now more than ever?” asked Kent Bishop, MD, chief medical officer, ProMedica Physicians and Acute Care. “They want community members to get the health screenings that might have been canceled or delayed due to the pandemic.”<br />The <a href='https://ehrn.org/'>Epic Health Research Network</a> published a study that showed how preventative cancer screenings in the United States dropped by 86% for colon screenings and by 94% for breast and cervical screenings following the declaration of the COVID-19 national emergency. The study also stated, “The number of cancer screenings has recently begun to rise, but has not yet reached previously expected levels.”<br />Many doctors, especially those who routinely screen patients, have expressed their concerns. Peter Klein, MD, ProMedica Physicians Colorectal Surgery, said, “We’ve seen cancer screenings decrease dramatically, and while patients are now starting to get their screenings, we’re seeing much more serious cases. It’s important to make that call and get scheduled for your health screenings.”<br />For more information on cancer screenings, visit <a href='https://www.promedica.org/assets/documents/patient-resources/cancerscreeningguidelines.pdf'>cancer screening guidelines</a>.<br />For more information on heart care, visit <a href='https://www.promedica.org/services-and-conditions/heart-care#heartHealth'>heart health</a>.<br />"

The ProMedica Impact Fund helps address needs that were already critical in so many communities and measure their impact on health outcomes and health care costs.<br />“This gift from the Ebeid family seeds the national ProMedica Impact Fund, which is accelerating the work of ProMedica’s SDOH institute to more communities,” said Gary Cates, ProMedica Foundation’s chief philanthropy officer. “This gift really builds on the legacy of Russell J. Ebeid’s support for SDOH, beginning with the Ebeid Center, then to the Ebeid Neighborhood Promise and now to make a difference on a national scale.”<br />“Russell wanted to change lives, to provide a hand up and not a handout. He understood how providing access to things like healthy food, financial coaching and safe housing can have a lasting, life-changing effect on health and well-being,” said the family of Russell J. Ebeid. “Supporting the ProMedica Impact Fund furthers Russell’s goal to touch as many lives as possible. It will help programs across the county that are demonstrating a positive impact on health.”<br />The PIF is being deployed in other targeted markets in cities across the United States to address specific SDOH needs in areas like food insecurity, housing and financial strain. ProMedica will be partnering with several national organizations to maximize the impact by directing more resources to the unique needs of each city.<br />Learn more about how ProMedica is addressing the <a href='https://www.promedica.org/social-determinants-of-health/'>Social Determinants of Health</a>.<br />Learn more about the <a href='https://www.promedica.org/impact-fund/'>ProMedica Impact Fund</a>.<br />"

Don Juan Express &amp; Cantina will be opening a new location in The Plaza, which is part of ProMedica’s downtown campus located at 300 Madison Avenue. The restaurant is expected to open in early July 2021.<br />Don Juan Express &amp; Cantina will be the Don Juan Mexican Bar &amp; Grill owner’s third restaurant in Northwest Ohio and first of the Express brand. Don Juan Mexican Bar &amp; Grill’s existing locations are at the Franklin Park Mall and in Maumee.<br />“Don Juan Express &amp; Cantina will have the same authentic Mexican cuisine at affordable prices as our other locations. However, this location will be distinctive as it is designed to cater to employees of downtown businesses and downtown residents who are looking for a quick, high-quality, lunch or dinner option that is within walking distance,” said Alberto Dominguez Martinez, owner. “We’re thrilled to be part of the reinvention of Downtown Toledo and offer something unique.”<br />The Plaza is being redesigned to offer exterior seating and a large patio for patrons of Don Juan Express &amp; Cantina. Adjacent to the patio will be a pedestrian boardwalk to encourage foot traffic and easy access between North St. Clair Street and Summit Street.<br />“The landscape of downtown Toledo is changing quickly and the revitalization of The Plaza is an exciting project,” said Robin Whitney, ProMedica’s chief strategic planning and real estate officer. “Don Juan Express &amp; Cantina will offer downtown residents, employees, and visitors a great option as they enjoy a newly renovated Summit Street area.”<br />"

The sanitizing robot has been proven to deactivate SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19) on surfaces in two minutes.<br /> The sanitizing robot offers hands-free sanitation to surfaces that may not be easily accessible using patented pulsed xenon UV light technology that will not damage materials or surfaces in a room. The broad spectrum UV light emitted by the sanitizing robot has been proven to quickly and safely destroy viruses and bacteria.<br /> Cloud technology allows the sanitizing robot to report key metrics to the ProMedica environmental services employee operating the sanitation device. Metrics include who last handled the device, how long it ran and which rooms have been disinfected. The sanitizing robot also has sensors that immediately shuts off the UV light when motion is detected in the room to ensure the operator's safety.<br /> 'ProMedica’s commitment to offering the highest level of quality care to its patients has always been a top priority,” said Sade Rolon, ProMedica associate vice president of environmental services. “Patients can now have an extra sense of comfort in knowing its facilities are safe and clean, even as we continue to fight the COVID-19 pandemic.” <br />ProMedica’s Risk Management Grant Program funded the sanitizing robot. Grant recipients are selected for equipment that aims to improve patient outcomes, ensure patient and employee safety and support or implement new best practices. <br />"

Powered by Kumanu’s PurposeCloud™ platform, Resourceful supports employers by addressing unrecognized Social Determinants of Health (SDOH) issues that can have a profound impact on employees’ quality of life and work.<br />SDOH are social and economic factors that are often root causes of employee health issues, lost productivity, and reduced engagement. SDOH directly impacts nearly one-third of all working Americans, according to a national survey conducted by The Harris Poll on behalf of ProMedica and Kumanu in December 2020.<br />Factors such as food insecurity, financial stress, housing insecurity, childcare or eldercare struggles, emotional well-being, and a lack of reliable transportation along with behaviors account for over 70% of health outcomes, according to the Institute for Clinical Systems Improvement. A ProMedica/Harris Poll survey conducted in December 2020 revealed that 24% of full-time workers in the U.S. had experienced food insecurity issues and 20% of respondents were worried about stable housing, and 27% said they were experiencing childcare challenges.<br />“Unmet employee needs related to Social Determinants of Health can have a significant impact on health and business outcomes,” said Randy Oostra, president and chief executive officer of ProMedica. “ProMedica’s decade-long experience in this area demonstrates that by effectively addressing SDOH needs, employers can help improve quality of life for employees while better positioning their companies for future success.”<br />Until now, employers have lacked practical solutions to assess these unrecognized risk factors – and, more importantly, meaningful solutions to address them. Resourceful empowers employers that want to demonstrate empathy and care for their employees by identifying unmet needs and by providing appropriate, accessible resources to address them.<br />Resourceful is a customizable platform designed for employers to de-stigmatize these issues and fill critical SDOH gaps unmet by traditional employer benefits and wellness solutions. Resourceful identifies risk factors in an employer’s workforce and helps activate people with purpose and connect them with resources available at work, or in their community, confidentially.<br />By identifying and connecting employees to resources, Resourceful can strengthen individuals’ resilience to be better able to bring their best selves to work. Employers benefit when employees’ emotional well-being and essential needs are being addressed.<br />The ProMedica National Social Determinants of Health Institute and Kumanu's purpose experts will provide consultative services for employers and customize the Resourceful platform to each organization’s unique needs to enhance existing employer wellness programs.<br />“People are emotionally and physically burned out and are struggling in many ways. The current mix of employer well-being solutions is falling short and fails to identify all of the factors that cause people hardship,” said Vic Strecher, Ph.D., Kumanu founder and CEO. “For the first time, Resourceful empowers employers to address essential needs and improve their employees’ sense of dignity by addressing the unmet SDOH needs and providing stigma-free, technology-driven access to resources.”<br />To start supporting your employees with Resourceful, visit us at <a href='https://www.kumanu.com/resourceful/'>kumanu.com/resourceful/</a>.<br />"

Additionally, a naloxone distribution program was piloted and is currently being implemented at all of its Ohio-based emergency departments (EDs).<br />This funding for the CCOED program will expand the current work ProMedica is doing in its Ohio-based EDs.<br />ProMedica is also partnering with Christ Hospital Health Network in Cincinnati and Premier Health in Dayton to combat opioid abuse. “These partners have demonstrated the ability and desire to collaborate, and through this alliance, we will reach high-priority counties in Ohio, including Butler, Hamilton, Lucas and Montgomery,” said Brian Kaminski, DO, emergency medicine physician and ProMedica vice president of quality and patient safety.<br />CCOED has three overarching goals:<br />Identify patients with opioid use disorder (OUD) by implementing a screening process in EDs;<br />Manage OUD by implementing evidence-based practices in emergency medicine; and<br />Transition patients to long-term care and supportive services using innovative processes that improve pathways to treatment. These goals will be met through comprehensive activities structured around screening, medication assisted treatment (MAT), naloxone distribution, linkages to care and a real-time treatment finder.<br />“The ED has proven to be a successful access point to reach all patients presenting to the ED with a history of opioid misuse, positive opiate drug screen and at-risk individuals being discharged with opioids,” said Kaminski. “The ED serves a wide variety of patients, including those who are experiencing health disparities and health inequities, as well as those who are uninsured and/or without access to primary care. We are able to better connect patients to needed services.”<br />Additionally, ProMedica will partner with Workit Health, FindLocalTreatment and the Center of Assessment and Evaluation Services (CAES) at Bowling Green State University. Workit Health will support activities associated with MAT and transition patients to long-term care, both on demand and through existing community resources. FindLocalTreatment will support access to real-time addiction treatment services, and CAES will provide evaluation services.<br />"

This designation permits local EMS to take patients in need of emergency heart care directly to ProMedica Flower Hospital instead of a farther location.<br />A STEMI heart attack is the deadliest kind of heart attack and is caused by a sudden, complete blockage of a coronary artery. As a result, the heart muscle is unable to receive blood and begins to fail.<br />“Every second really counts, especially during this type of heart attack, and having this emergency care available in the Sylvania area will be excellent for patients,” said Stacey Karnes, director of nursing for cardiac care.<br />Staff from ProMedica Toledo Hospital cardiac cath lab rotate to the lab at ProMedica Flower Hospital and bring their experience and dedication to caring for this population of patients.<br />To treat this type of heart attack, blood flow must be restored quickly to reduce a patient’s risk of damage to the heart or death. Treatment can include medication therapy, a non-surgical catheter procedure known as percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), or surgery.<br />“It has really been an exciting, strategic process to establish this level of care, complete with a new cardiac cath lab at our hospital,” said Darrell Wachowiak, president of ProMedica Flower Hospital. “Our highly skilled physicians are highly trained in STEMI care and have been recognized by the American College of Cardiology.”<br />"

This has proven to be a strenuous task for health care workers and often leads to staff needing to take turns to provide high-quality manual compressions. <br />The LUCAS device takes this strain off clinical team members by providing consistent, effective and uninterrupted CPR on the patient. This allows medical staff to focus on delivering other patient care tactics, including defibrillation, intubation, IV placement and, if needed, transportation. <br />“The addition of the LUCAS device to the Emergency Department in Fostoria allows the staff taking care of patients who need CPR to focus on other just as important aspects of care, in these critical moments,” said Sally Simcoe, RN, ProMedica Fostoria Community Hospital emergency department nurse manager. “Good quality CPR is the key to patient survival, and we hope to see better outcomes with the use of this device.” <br />The LUCAS device was obtained thanks to a grant received from the ProMedica Fostoria Community Hospital Foundation. <br />"

By leveraging their respective skills and expertise, ProMedica, the nation’s largest not-for-profit senior care provider, and MetroHealth are uniquely positioned to improve health care connectivity and access to resources that support healthy aging in the Cleveland area.<br />The new facility is expected to open in late 2021 and will be called ProMedica Skilled Nursing and Rehabilitation at MetroHealth. The state-of-the-art facility, which is to have 96 beds, will be housed on four floors in the former Deaconess Hospital at 4229 Pearl Road. It will provide medically complex and intensive rehabilitation services for short-term patients transitioning from hospital to home, in addition to 24-hour skilled nursing care. Old Brooklyn will become a hub for healthy aging resources that not only includes skilled nursing and rehabilitation services provided by ProMedica, but also offers convenient access to inpatient rehabilitation services, geriatricians and geriatric specialists.<br />“The need for high quality skilled nursing and rehabilitation care continues to grow. This partnership will benefit our patients as we focus on their entire care continuum,” said MetroHealth President and CEO Akram Boutros, MD. “ProMedica is a great partner because it is anchored in Ohio and is a nationally recognized expert in achieving successful outcomes for patients transitioning home after a hospital stay.”<br />“ProMedica has a strong skilled nursing care presence in Cleveland, and we are excited to partner with another forward-thinking Ohio-based health care organization to provide the community with enhanced post-hospital services,” stated Randy Oostra, FACHE, ProMedica’s president and chief executive officer. “Working with MetroHealth to bring innovative approaches to care that combines high tech with high touch, we seek to enhance the patient experience and improve health outcomes. “Together, we will offer a truly unique health care alternative in our community for those recovering from illness, injury or surgery.”<br />The center will feature an innovative gym, spacious private rooms and baths with flat screen televisions, WiFi service, attractive social areas with a focus on patient safety, dignity and personal preferences.<br />The next step in developing the new facility will be securing regulatory approvals from the Ohio Department of Health. Construction is expected to begin as soon as the appropriate approvals are received.<br />This announcement comes as construction is already underway on an additional $9 million worth of investments MetroHealth is making at the Old Brooklyn Campus. These projects include the expansion of a research program that draws participants from around the world who have suffered spinal injuries and strokes, as well as new and improved space for the nationally recognized MetroHealth Rehabilitation Institute.<br />"

Racial, ethnic, socio-economic and gender diversity will be at the core of the innovation center’s mission.<br />Bitwise’s apprenticeship approach allows people to earn-while-they-learn, removing the financial barriers of traditional education and professional advancement opportunities. Technology is one of the fastest-growing industries in the United States and positions in the field are high-wage, high-growth jobs. The Bitwise model empowers communities of concentrated poverty to access quality jobs in the fastest-growing industry in the global economy.<br />As Bitwise opens a regional office in Toledo at the innovation center, it expects to generate hundreds of jobs over time. The company also expects to expand partnerships that open up job opportunities for the technology workforce it will train.<br />'I am the daughter of field workers from one of the poorest areas of California. Through a fortunate series of events, I found myself at the University of Toledo graduating with a degree in Computer Science and working in the tech industry with professional possibilities I never could have dreamed of as a child,' said Irma L. Olguin Jr., CEO and co-founder, Bitwise Industries. 'This country is filled with stories similar to mine - people from underserved communities, who never thought these kinds of opportunities would be accessible to them. Together, Bitwise and ProMedica are working to make what was serendipity in my life far more common for the people of Toledo. By connecting people to the skills they need to enter the technology industry, and by surrounding them with a vibrant and inclusive space, we will lift up the entire region.'<br />“We are extremely pleased to be partnering with Bitwise and to be its first community project outside of California,” said Randy Oostra, president and CEO, ProMedica. “The company has a strong track record, and its mission strongly aligns with ProMedica’s social determinants of health and innovations efforts. We believe this partnership will enable us to build upon our successes and continue the momentum in our community. Together, and with the help of other community partners, we expect to elevate the innovation and technology landscape in our region while creating career path opportunities for our underserved populations.”<br />As a Toledo-based anchor institution and leader in addressing the social determinants of health, ProMedica understands the role economic vitality plays in the community’s overall health and well-being. For a community to improve, opportunities need to exist for everyone in the community. That understanding motivates ProMedica to partner and invest in catalytic projects like the innovation center to spur economic development and support a better quality of life for everyone in the community.<br />ProMedica’s investment in the innovation center builds upon the work the organization has been doing as part of the ProMedica Ebeid Neighborhood Promise in the Uptown neighborhood. Accordingly, the innovation center will have a strong focus on jobs, education, health, stability and resident engagement.<br />With ProMedica’s strong commitment to innovation in health care, including leveraging technology to provide more hospital-level care to patients at home, there is a growing need for technologically savvy employees. The high-tech job training that will occur as part of this partnership will help support the workforce needs in health care and beyond.<br />The innovation center's location will be the former Jefferson Center, which ProMedica is in the process of acquiring. The Jefferson Center is expected to undergo a renovation, and Bitwise will be a partner in the development of the innovation center. The center will also serve as a business incubator for technology and non-technology businesses to foster synergies and create new opportunities. Building renovations are expected to begin in late 2021, and occupancy will start in early 2023. Bitwise will launch its operations in a temporary space so that its work in Toledo can start in 2021.<br />“We are incredibly excited to welcome Bitwise Industries, a Fresno, California-based tech apprenticeship engine, working in partnership with ProMedica, to Toledo for the launch of an innovation center that will focus on accelerating partnerships, supporting workforce development, and facilitating technology innovation,” Mayor Wade Kapszukiewicz said.<br />“JobsOhio and our partners welcome Bitwise Industries’ plans to partner with ProMedica to bring hundreds of new jobs to Ohio,” said J.P. Nauseef, JobsOhio president and CEO. “This investment reinforces our commitment to Northwest Ohio and is further evidence that Ohio’s value proposition is resonating more and more with tech businesses on the Coasts.'<br />The project is contingent on the approval of state and local incentives. JobsOhio also plans to provide assistance that will be made public after the final agreement has been executed.<br />"

ProMedica Memorial Hospital is proud to have received the Education Recognition Certificate since 2005.<br /> The certification provides patients peace of mind when selecting treatment options to manage their diabetes. The services selected have demonstrated high-quality education that provides patients the necessary tools to improve their diabetes management at home.

In Lucas County alone, heart disease and stroke accounted for 35 percent of deaths from 2016 – 2018, according to the Ohio Department of Health. The 2019-2020 Lucas County Health Assessment found that 29 percent of Lucas County adults had been diagnosed with high blood pressure, 27 percent had high blood cholesterol, 38 percent were obese, and 15 percent were smokers — four known risk factors for heart disease and stroke.<br />To reverse this trend, ProMedica and the American Heart Association encourage the community to go red and take charge of heart health in the following ways:<br />Schedule an appointment with your health provider: Learn about your health status and risk factors.<br />Get active: The American Heart Association recommends getting at least two hours and 30-minutes of moderate physical activity each week.<br />Eat healthily: A heart-healthy diet is rich in fruit, vegetables, fiber and whole grains and low in sodium.<br />Know the signs and symptoms of a heart attack and stroke: Heart attack symptoms differ in men and women, and time is brain when it comes to a stroke. Call 911. Learn hands-only CPR.<br />To learn more about the symptoms of a heart attack, visit <a href='https://www.promedica.org/yourhealth/heartmonth/'>promedica.org/heartcare</a>.<br />“We really want to raise awareness, especially right now during a pandemic, that it is so important to seek medical treatment right away if you are having heart attack symptoms,” said William Colyer, MD, ProMedica Physicians Cardiology. “Delaying care could further damage your heart. The safest place to be if you are experiencing symptoms is at the hospital.”<br />Heart attack symptoms often involve chest discomfort, pain or discomfort in one or both arm or the jaw, shortness of breath and lightheadedness.<br />ProMedica is encouraging its employees to wear red for National Wear Red Day on Feb. 5 to specifically raise awareness of heart disease in women.<br />ProMedica HealthConnect, ProMedica’s health and wellness website (<a href='http://www.promedicahealthconnect.org'>www.promedicahealthconnect.org</a>), as well as ProMedica’s social media accounts, will feature a series of heart-related articles and videos and heart-healthy recipes.<br />"

The goal of the investment is to help support a neighborhood that traditionally has experienced disinvestment, which has disproportionally affected people of color. Reinvesting in neighborhoods like the Junction is a critical step in creating infrastructure and opportunities for all of our neighbors.<br />To support this community, the Owens Corning Foundation helped fund the grant investment program. “We realize the positive impact this investment will have in the neighborhood and the greater community, and we are pleased to join forces to help make a lasting difference,” said Don Rettig, president of the Owens Corning Foundation.<br />Kicking off the program in fall of 2020, ProMedica sought grant applicants that could help in the areas of education and training, health and wellness, jobs and finances, stable housing and basic needs for the Junction neighborhood.<br />To ensure the grant application review process included resident input, ProMedica engaged community partners and neighborhood leaders through several community meetings. The stakeholders were instrumental in the process, reviewing neighborhood-level data and plans and administering a survey to gauge neighborhood need.<br />Shantae Brownlee, a Junction neighborhood resident and stakeholder who participated in the community meetings, said, “The process of selecting the programs that would make the most impact on our community was extensive, but I’m proud of the selections and looking forward to real change.”<br />ProMedica received more than 40 applications. Twenty projects and 18 organizations were identified to receive funding based on the goals, predicted outcomes and programming that addressed specific health and human service challenges facing the Junction community.<br />The MLK Kitchen for the Poor is among the organizations receiving funding. The Kitchen currently serves meals to more than 200 people each day, from school-aged children to the elderly. The grant investment program will fund its food box and hot meals program. “This past year, more than ever, we have been seeing people in need of basic necessities. Providing hot meals and food boxes makes a tangible difference in the health of our community. My late father opened the Kitchen in 1969, and this funding will continue his legacy,” said Harvey Savage, Jr., executive director, The MLK Kitchen.<br />Another organization to receive grant funding is the Neighborhood Health Association, which provides access to quality medical care for anyone in need. The grant program will fund the “Saving Ourselves” program, which seeks to staff a full-time community organizer. The organizer will connect Junction residents to basic needs and organize residents in the development and implementation of a strategy for changing the health status of the community. “Providing the right access allows us to empower and educate while aggressively working to eliminate health care inequities,” said Doni Miller, chief executive officer, Neighborhood Health Association.<br />The first installment in the grant payments for the two-year cycle will start January 2021, enabling organizations to begin programming at the beginning of the year. Funding is for a minimum two-year period and contingent upon successful, demonstrable achievement of outcomes.<br />"

The health system is shifting from its Visitor Restriction Level 3 down to Level 2. The change is in response to health care employees being able to receive the COVID-19 vaccine. While COVID-19 remains a threat in our communities, ProMedica must balance that threat with other aspects of patient well-being that are linked to visitation. <br />Notable visitor restriction changes include: Non-COVID-19 patients will now be allowed one visitor wearing a mask, but COVID-19 patients will continue to have no visitors if they are in isolation.

We Honor Veterans was launched by the National Hospice and Palliative Care Organization in collaboration with the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to help improve the care veterans receive from hospice and palliative care providers. <br /> 'It is such an honor to have achieved Level Four with the We Honor Veterans Program. Our hospice team takes care of many veterans and being a part of this program allows us to honor and respect their end of life in a way that is truly fitting to their needs and something our veterans deserve,” said Emily Foreman, bereavement coordinator and co-chair of ProMedica’s We Honor Veterans program. <br /> Sherri Wilbur, nursing assistant and We Honor Veterans program co-chair said, “We believe in providing the utmost care to all of our patients. This partnership gives us the tools and education needed to tailor our practice to veteran-specific needs. This is just one of the many ways we ensure we provide the best care possible. We look forward to pursuing Level Five in the coming year.”<br /> The We Honor Veterans program provides four levels of recognition to organizations that demonstrate a commitment to improving care for veterans. To reach Level Four, ProMedica was tasked with learning more about caring for veterans, declaring a commitment to honoring veterans at the end of life, providing education for hospice staff and volunteers on caring for veterans and partnering with the VA at the local, regional and national level to ensure the unique needs of veterans are met.  <br /> To learn more about the We Honor Veterans initiative, the steps our agencies have taken to receive this acknowledgment or to see where other ProMedica agencies are at in the process of achieving this honor, visit <a href='http://www.wehonorveterans.org'>www.wehonorveterans.org</a>.<br />"

Patients must have a scheduled appointment to be vaccinated.<br />ProMedica will administer the COVID-19 vaccines currently available while working closely with state and county health departments to obtain additional vaccines. Please note that ProMedica will need to temporarily close scheduling when its vaccine supply runs out, but will reopen scheduling as soon as its hospitals receive additional shipments from the state.<br />ProMedica Patients Ages 65+<br />ProMedica patients ages 65 and older should be on the lookout for a message in their ProMedica MyChart accounts beginning on January 9 that will enable them to schedule their vaccine appointments online. Please note that not all qualified patients will receive the message on day one. It may be days or even weeks before they receive their message to schedule, depending on how quickly ProMedica receives additional vaccines. Scheduling through ProMedica MyChart will be the easiest and most effective way for these individuals to secure their appointments. If ProMedica patients do not have their ProMedica MyChart accounts set up yet, they can do so by visiting <a href='https://mychart.promedica.org/MyChart/signup'>promedica.org/mychartsignup</a>.<br />Non-ProMedica Patients and Essential Workers<br />Individuals who are not ProMedica patients – or – are ProMedica patients under age 65 who are in one of the approved essential worker categories for Phase 1b would need to call 567-585-1900, Monday through Friday, between 8 a.m. and 5 p.m., to schedule a vaccine appointment. Please note that this phone number is not for ProMedica patients ages 65 and older since they will be prompted to schedule their vaccination appointments in ProMedica MyChart to accommodate the large number of individuals in that group.<br />ProMedica appreciates the community’s patience as its hospitals work to secure and distribute COVID-19 vaccines to Phase 1b individuals who want to be protected and want to protect others around them.<br />For more information about COVID-19 and the vaccine, please visit <a href='https://www.promedica.org/covid/'>promedica.org/covid</a>.<br />"

It is most commonly caused by trauma, such as car accidents or falls but may occur in the setting of blood thinners or spontaneously. This condition can be very serious and may even result in death or disability.<br />“The trial involves a glue-like substance that is injected into the leaking blood vessel in an attempt to shut down the blood vessel and prevent a recurrent bleed,” said Syed Zaidi, MD, ProMedica physicians neurology, “This could be a huge advancement in the treatment of subdural hematomas.”<br />Participating in the study does not change the length of stay in the hospital for the patients. Patients follow a regular standard of care other than enrolling to treatment or observation in the study.<br />“The fact that our stroke team at ProMedica is not only participating in national clinical trials, but leading the way by enrolling the first patient, demonstrates our deep commitment to exceptional clinical care,” said Dawn Buskey, ProMedica president of acute care.<br />"

The solution offers a network of services and health care professionals who are available to respond to a patient’s health concerns at any time.<br />The health care model offers individualized care plans and a variety of features, including:<br />24 hours-a-day, seven days-a-week access to a patient’s care team that will respond to medical needs in person, by video and/or telephone<br />Patients are under the care of a hospitalist and they receive daily video visits by the physician and acute care nurses<br />Vital signs obtained using remote monitoring equipment<br />In-home visits by health care professionals, such as mobile integrated health paramedics, registered nurses, nurse practitioners and physical and occupational therapists<br />Lab tests, mobile imaging like X-ray and ultrasound, and IV therapies performed in a patient’s home<br />Durable medical equipment like shower chairs, grab bars, oxygen and hospital beds<br />Collaboration with a patient’s primary care physician and/or specialists<br />Complete report of a patient’s care sent to his or her primary care physician<br />“When we live by our mission and values, we create an environment that is centered around our patients. The goal of ProMedica Acute Care at Home is to deliver acute hospital-level care to patients in the comfort of their own home,” said Holly Bristoll, chief integration officer, ProMedica. “By providing this level of care when appropriate, we are able to improve patient outcomes while reducing health care costs and enhancing the patient experience.”<br />ProMedica admitted its first patient to ProMedica Acute Care at Home on October 1, 2020. The service, which is covered by some commercial insurance plans, is one of the first in the nation to receive approval for a special waiver from the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS). The waiver, developed to help U.S. hospitals and health systems manage inpatient volume during the COVID-19 pandemic, enables ProMedica Toledo Hospital and ProMedica Flower Hospital to provide ProMedica Acute Care at Home to qualified Medicare patients. ProMedica plans to request CMS approval for additional hospitals within its system soon.<br />“We are glad we have ProMedica Acute Care at Home up and running, especially given the needs associated with the current pandemic,” said Bristoll. “Also, we are grateful CMS recognized the benefits of being able to treat qualified acute care patients in home settings and acknowledged ProMedica’s ability to appropriately and safely provide this innovative care.”<br />A 2016 study by the Commonwealth Fund compared patients in traditional hospitals with similar conditions to patients who received hospital-level care at home. The patients who received hospital-level care at home experienced fewer readmissions, lower mortality rates, reduced falls and lower costs.<br />“In addition to enabling better outcomes for patients, the ProMedica Acute Care at Home option allows patients to be more engaged and empowered with their medical care,” said Brian Perkins, MD, vice president, medical operations, ProMedica Acute Care at Home. “Doctors and nurses can see patients who are in the comfort of their own living space, and help evaluate any physical barriers in the house, stay abreast of dietary needs or changes, and monitor emotional health and well-being.”<br />ProMedica chose Medically Home Group as its ProMedica Acute Care at Home partner based on the organization’s innovative clinical and services model for delivering acute-level hospital care in the home. Medically Home’s technology platform and associated decision-support and advanced analytics functions allow physicians and nurses to manage all aspects of a patient’s care, the supply chain needed to deliver that care in the home, and the collection and proper handling of patient data, meshing with hospital electronic health record systems.<br />“Together with ProMedica, Medically Home leadership shares a passion for transforming health care to include stronger bonds between patient and health care provider, reduced costs, improved clinical outcomes, faster recovery times, and a return to a more compassionate delivery of high-acuity care in the patient's home, when appropriate,” said Rami Karjian, CEO of Medically Home.<br />The Hospital at Home Model: Bringing Hospital-Level Care to the Patient (Sarah Klein, Martha Hostetter and Douglas McCarthy; Commonwealth Fund; 2016)<br /><br />"

The rigorous standards are defined in each year’s Top Hospital Methodology.<br />“Being recognized as a Top Hospital is an extraordinary feat and we are honored to recognize ProMedica Bixby Hospital this year,” said Leah Binder, president and CEO of The Leapfrog Group. “Despite the extraordinary pressure and strain of the COVID-19 pandemic, ProMedica Bixby Hospital has demonstrated an unwavering dedication to patients and to the Adrian community. We congratulate the board, staff and clinicians whose efforts made this honor possible.”<br />To qualify for the Top Hospitals distinction, hospitals must rank top among peers on the Leapfrog Hospital Survey, which assesses hospital performance on the highest standards for quality and patient safety, and achieve top performance in its category.

Modern Healthcare and our readers selected the 100 most innovative and resilient candidates…which this year comprised a record number of women…who influenced the course that healthcare took during a global pandemic, continued to press forward amidst uncertainty, and used current events like the election, racial injustice and public health as an inspiration to do better. Congratulations to our honorees.'<br />“In a year like 2020, it’s especially an honor for ProMedica to be recognized by Modern Healthcare,” said Randy Oostra, president and CEO, ProMedica. “This year, we have faced unprecedented challenges, and ProMedica team members have worked tirelessly to care for and support our patients, residents, members and their families.

The updates involve community projects in Toledo, Ohio, where the national organization is headquartered.<br />The first update involves a gift ProMedica recently committed to Metroparks Toledo to help support the Glass City Metropark &amp; Riverwalk development. ProMedica has agreed to donate $10 million to the project over the next six years. The gift will help create a well-designed public green space with a range of activities in the city’s core where people can connect, recreate, exercise, relax, discover, learn, and experience the health benefits of nature. The park project is also expected to benefit the community by attracting visitors, creating jobs, driving economic growth, and conserving and preserving its most important natural resources.<br />“With the need to socially distance ourselves much of this year, many of us have developed an even greater appreciation for Metroparks Toledo and the role it plays in our community,” said Robin Whitney, Chief Strategic Planning and Real Estate Officer, ProMedica. “ProMedica has long been aware of the health and well-being benefits associated with outdoor activity and being in nature. So, we are excited to join our community in supporting a world-class park project that will bring the positive physical and mental health benefits of being outdoors to our most urban setting. We expect this to be a truly transformative project that revitalizes our waterfront, unites multiple neighborhoods from both sides of the river, and attracts others to our community to create opportunities and support ongoing economic development.”<br />“This gift to the community, through the Metroparks Toledo Foundation, will help Metroparks keep its promise to leverage the taxpayers’ investment and transform our waterfront into the showpiece of our region,” said Joe Napoli, president of the Foundation. “Having ProMedica as a lead partner in this philanthropic effort makes a strong statement about the value of Riverwalk to our community.”<br />'Randy Oostra's vision and ProMedica's leadership in creating the Downtown Master Plan and their partnership with Metroparks to acquire the Marina District got us to where we are today,' said Scott Savage, president of the Board of Park Commissioners. 'Today's announcement is another significant contribution to making the Toledo region a healthier, more vibrant place to live.'<br />The second project for which there is an update relates to ProMedica’s 2019 announcement about its gift to help with the redevelopment of the SeaGate Convention Centre. As an acknowledgment of ProMedica’s early commitment to the project, the Toledo-Lucas County Convention and Visitor’s Bureau granted ProMedica the exclusive right to name the convention center. The name chosen by ProMedica is the Glass City Convention and Event Center.<br />“We chose a name that reflects our community’s unique history, current accomplishments, and hope for an even brighter future, said Whitney. “The ‘Glass City’ moniker is not original, but it emphasizes a major point of pride in our community, with glass having long been part of our industry, art and architecture. As we eventually move beyond the pandemic, we look forward to our community being able to promote a thoughtfully redeveloped convention and event center with a name that evokes pride locally and sparks interest nationally.”<br />“We are grateful to ProMedica for being our naming rights partner for the convention center as we begin a new era to attract high-caliber events and attractions to the region. The Glass City Convention and Event Center will play a key role in a reenergized downtown Toledo. We look forward to a continued relationship with ProMedica and we are excited for this new partnership, new direction, and new name,” said Tina Skeldon Wozniak, President of the Board of Lucas County Commissioners.<br />“The Commissioners and ProMedica share the same vision for our community in our desire to make Toledo and Lucas County a destination for visitors and to have a healthy, vibrant quality of life for everyone. The Glass City Metropark and the expanded Glass City Convention and Event Center with a dedicated ballroom will be game changers to the local tourism economy and a catalyst for regional growth,” said Commissioner Pete Gerken.<br />“During this national public health crisis, we have learned the value that our residents place in the outdoor experience and their appreciation of our Metroparks. The Glass City Metropark and Riverwalk will create new opportunities for our community to improve their health and explore the outdoors - and it truly complements the new ballroom and renovated convention center. We congratulate the ProMedica leadership for making these incredible contributions to our community,” said Commissioner Gary L. Byers.<br />"

Each year, Healthgrades evaluates hospital performance at nearly 4,500 hospitals nationwide for 32 of the most common inpatient procedures and conditions using Medicare data, and all-payer data from 16 states for bariatrics and appendectomy procedures.*<br />This analysis shows that patients treated at hospitals receiving a 5-star rating have a lower risk of dying and a lower risk of experiencing one or more complications during a hospital stay than if they were treated at hospitals receiving a 1-star rating in that procedure or condition. From 2017 through 2019, if all hospitals as a group performed similarly to hospitals receiving 5-stars as a group, on average, 218,785 lives could potentially have been saved and complications in 148,681 patients could potentially have been avoided.[i]<br />For the last decade, ProMedica Monroe Regional Hospital has been recognized as a 5-Star Hospital for those needing treatment for pneumonia.

Every year, Healthgrades evaluates hospital performance at nearly 4,500 hospitals nationwide for 32 of the most common inpatient procedures and conditions using Medicare data, and additional analyzes outcomes in appendectomy and bariatric surgery using all-payer data provided by 16 states. The hospital was recognized under its previous name since its transition into ProMedica Hickman Hospital did not happen until late September 2020.<br />This analysis shows that patients treated at hospitals receiving a 5-star rating have a lower risk of dying and a lower risk of experiencing one or more complications during a hospital stay than if they were treated at hospitals receiving a 1-star rating in that procedure or condition. From 2017 through 2019, if all hospitals as a group performed similarly to hospitals receiving 5-stars as a group, on average, 218,785 lives could potentially have been saved and complications in 148,681 patients could potentially have been avoided.<br />Additionally, Healthgrades assesses outcomes in elective care and the relative performance of 5-star hospitals vs 1- and 3-star hospitals and how this may affect patients. During the assessment, Healthgrades was able to discover patients treated for respiratory failure at 1-star rated facilities were 2.0 times more likely to die than patients treated at 5-star facilities, which is one specialty area ProMedica Bixby Hospital was recognized as a 5-Star Recipient for four consecutive years.<br />“Hospital quality has never been more important, and consumers are becoming more aware of the importance of researching where they receive care before they visit a hospital for a specific procedure or condition,” said Brad Bowman, MD, Chief Medical Officer at Healthgrades. “Hospitals that receive a Healthgrades 5-star rating for specialty service lines demonstrate exceptional outcomes and their ability to provide quality care for patients.” <br /> <br />“Being recognized as a 5-star hospital in several different specialty areas is truly the best way to end ProMedica Bixby Hospital’s legacy as our team transitioned to a new facility,” said Julie Yaroch, DO, president of ProMedica Charles and Virginia Hickman Hospital. “We are excited to be recognized for our superior clinical outcomes and to now be able to deliver the same high quality care to the Adrian community at the new ProMedica Charles and Virginia Hickman Hospital.”<br />ProMedica Bixby Hospital also received the following recognition from Healthgrades for superior clinical care achievements:<br />Five-Star Recipient for Treatment of Respiratory Failure for 4 Years in a Row (2018-2021)<br />Five-Star Recipient for Colorectal Surgeries for 3 Years in a Row (2019-2021)<br />Five-Star Recipient for Treatment of Bowel Obstruction for 3 Years in a Row (2019-2021)<br />Five-Star Recipient for Treatment of Sepsis for 2 Years in a Row (2020-2021)<br />Five-Star Recipient for Treatment of Pneumonia (2021)<br />For its analysis, Healthgrades evaluated approximately 45 million Medicare inpatient records for nearly 4,500 short-term acute care hospitals nationwide to assess hospital performance in 32 common conditions and procedures, and evaluated outcomes in appendectomy and bariatric surgery using all-payer data provided by 16 states. Healthgrades recognizes a hospital’s quality achievements for cohort-specific performance, specialty area performance, and overall clinical quality. Individual procedure or condition cohorts are designated as 5-star (statistically significantly better than expected), 3-star (not statistically different from expected) and 1-star (statistically significantly worse than expected).

For appendectomy and bariatric surgery, Healthgrades used inpatient data from 16 states that provide all-payer data for years 2016 through 2018.<br />"

The study, “A Randomized Open Label Phase 2b/3 Study of the Safety and Efficacy of NP-120 (Ifenprodil) for the Treatment of Hospitalized Patients with Confirmed COVID-19 Disease”, is investigating the safety and efficacy of Ifenprodil on lung function, health status and SARS-CoV-2 RNA status in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 disease. The study is sponsored by Algernon Pharmaceuticals located in Vancouver British Columbia, Canada.<br />Ifenprodil, an NMDA antagonist, may be useful in preventing virus-induced acute lung injury. In vitro studies suggest Ifenprodil may block the activation of T cells and cytokine release, and therefore, could be a potent anti-inflammatory agent.<br />According to the Principal Investigator, ProMedica Critical Care physician, Marla Matal, MD “Our hope is to prevent patients from getting intubated and suffering through the mental and physical agony of a prolonged ICU stay.”<br />Other ProMedica study team members include Sub-investigator, Greg Kasper, MD, Clinical Research Coordinators, Jessica Shoemaker, RN, and Bailea Bobich, RN and pharmacists Beth Martin, Elice Martin and David Chen.<br />The study is currently screening and enrolling at ProMedica Toledo Hospital and ProMedica Bay Park Hospital.

Nuclear medicine is a branch of medical imaging that uses small amounts of radioactive material to diagnose and treat a variety of diseases, including many types of cancers, heart disease and certain other abnormalities within the body.<br />“Earning the ACR accreditation in nuclear medicine is one way Fostoria Community Hospital strives to provide safe, high-quality radiology and imaging services to the community,” said Nathan Egbert, MD, medical director of radiology at Fostoria Community Hospital.<br />The ACR gold seal of accreditation represents the highest level of image quality and patient safety. It is awarded only to facilities meeting ACR Practice Parameters and Technical Standards after a peer-review evaluation by board-certified physicians and medical physicists who are experts in the field. Image quality, personnel qualifications, adequacy of facility equipment, quality control procedures and quality assurance programs are assessed. The findings are reported to the ACR Committee on Accreditation, which subsequently provides the practice with a comprehensive report that can be used for continuous practice improvement.<br />The ACR, founded in 1924, is a professional medical society dedicated to serving patients and society by empowering radiology professionals to advance the practice, science and professions of radiological care. The College serves more than 37,000 diagnostic/interventional radiologists, radiation oncologists, nuclear medicine physicians, and medical physicists with programs focusing on the practice of medical imaging and radiation oncology and the delivery of comprehensive health care services.<br />"

ProMedica Toledo Hospital is one of only 124 hospitals nationwide to receive the honor.<br />The award recognizes ProMedica Toledo Hospital’s commitment and success in implementing a higher standard of care for heart attack patients and signifies that ProMedica Toledo Hospital has reached an aggressive goal of treating these patients to standard levels of care as outlined by the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association clinical guidelines and recommendations. Specifically, these three areas contributed to the award: the Emergency Department, CardioVascular Services, and the ProMedica Toledo Hospital Cardiac Nursing Units.<br />To receive the Chest Pain - MI Registry Silver Performance Achievement Award, ProMedica Toledo Hospital has demonstrated sustained achievement in the Chest Pain - MI Registry for four consecutive quarters during 2019 and performed with distinction in specific performance measures. Full participation in the registry engages hospitals in a robust quality improvement process using data to drive improvements in adherence to guideline recommendations and overall quality of care provided to heart attack patients.<br />“As a Silver Performance Award recipient, ProMedica Toledo Hospital has established itself as a leader in setting the national standard for improving quality of care in patients with acute myocardial infarction,” said Michael C.

The targeted pain conditions that will be a point of focus at both facilities include:<br />Headache/migraine<br />Extremity fracture/sprain<br />Low back pain<br />Dental pain<br />Renal colic (pain associated with kidney stone)<br />To supplement the non-opioid medication alternatives, non-pharmacological pain reduction interventions will be used as enhanced pain-alleviating strategies. The grant from SAMHSA will allow the emergency departments to increase their use of non-pharmacological alternatives by 20 percent or more. These interventions include physical therapy, acupuncture, and cognitive behavioral therapy among others.<br />The PAIN project’s goal is to decrease the number of opioids prescribed to patients presenting with acute pain-related conditions at ProMedica Toledo Hosptial and ProMedica Flower Hospital Emergency Departments by 45 percent, or more, over the next three years.<br />“We look forward to having the opportunity to further provide the best quality of care to our patients,” said Brian Kaminski, DO, ProMedica vice president of quality and safety. “With the increased need to address the number of opioids prescribed to patients, this grant should allow us to provide these specific services to approximately 8,000 individuals over the next three years.”<br />By August 31, 2023, the PAIN project will offer medication-assisted treatment and subsequent referral for ongoing treatment to 90 percent of patients who present to ProMedica Toledo Hospital and ProMedica Flower Hospital Emergency Departments with a substance use disorder.<br />This project will enhance existing efforts at ProMedica Toledo Hosptial and ProMedica Flower Hospital Emergency Departments to address the growing number of opioid overdoses treated at each facility and reduce the number of patients with opiate use disorder.<br />"

The event will be televised on the Golf Channel nationwide all three days. During the event, ProMedica will air several nationally-televised messages aimed at explaining:<br />The social determinants of health<br />How they affect health outcomes<br />The disparities associated with them<br />The social determinants of health are the social, economic, and environmental factors that impact health risks and outcomes. They include factors such as food insecurity, financial strain, housing, behavioral health, transportation, violence risks, and childcare. While these needs already have been critical in many communities, they are now being intensified by the COVID-19 pandemic.<br />ProMedica has long served as a national leader in addressing the social determinants of health. To help further awareness about the cause, the organization has designated August as Social Determinants of Health Awareness Month.<br />The partnership with the LPGA Drive On Championship provides a major opportunity to bolster national awareness of SDOH leading into August. During the event, LPGA players are expected to show their support for social determinants of health awareness by wearing green ribbons.<br />“We’re pleased to be partnering with the LPGA to raise awareness for a cause as important as the social determinants of health,” said Randy Oostra, president and CEO of ProMedica. “The need for awareness and intervention is greater than ever before, especially in light of the pandemic. ProMedica has been committed to advancing SDOH initiatives for more than a decade, and we are always excited to form new partnerships that enable us to further our efforts.”<br />Moving beyond awareness to bold action, ProMedica Foundation has established the <a href='https://www.promedica.org/impactfund/pages/default.aspx'>ProMedica Impact Fund</a>, a nationwide philanthropic approach to improving the health and well-being of individuals by accelerating efforts around SDOH. ProMedica will encourage donations to the fund throughout the LPGA event.<br />"

They include factors such as food insecurity, financial strain, housing, behavioral health, transportation, violence risks, and childcare. While clinical care accounts for only 20 percent of health outcomes, SDOH and behavior taken together influence around 80 percent, according to the Institute for Clinical Systems Improvement.<br />'The unmet needs around Social Determinants of Health – especially now as we contend with COVID-19 – demand a strong response from health care organizations and employers alike,' noted Randy Oostra, president and chief executive officer of ProMedica. 'Our decade-long experience addressing these needs, including pilot work with employers, demonstrates that focusing efforts in this area pays real dividends for employers, plus, it's the right thing to do for people. And now – working with our colleagues at Kumanu – we can do so at scale. Kumanu's work in life purpose is a major new addition to our SDOH work, and it adds one more very important piece as we try to improve individuals' personal, social and economic factors.'<br />The ProMedica Social Determinants of Health Institute has been a national leader in effectively addressing SDOH in clinical settings and communities for more than a decade. Kumanu is known for its technology that fuses the latest neuroscience research with behavior design and machine learning to amplify and activate purpose, increase resilience, change mindsets, and achieve enduring behavior change. Drawing on both organizations' exceptional strengths, the new employee-focused well-being solution enables employers to take a purposeful and targeted approach to addressing the social determinants of health to reduce risks and improve health for their employees and organizations.<br />Powered by Kumanu’s PurposeCloud™ platform, this new employer-customizable solution incorporates:<br />Advanced analytics and predictive modeling to project population needs and risks<br />An easy-to-deploy confidential employee assessment tool<br />An app that uses purpose to amplify motivation while connecting people to health and human service resources<br />Consultative resources from The ProMedica Social Determinants of Health Institute and Kumanu purpose experts to integrate with existing employer well-being programs and incorporate best practices<br />Reporting and analytic dashboards that provide an aggregated view of risk, needs, engagement trends, and projected outcomes<br />“We’re delighted to partner with ProMedica in producing a robust solution that helps unlock the power of purpose, uncover latent needs, and build durable connections that make a profound difference in the lives of people, and the organizations they work for,” added Vic Strecher, PhD, founder and chief executive officer of Kumanu.<br />The new SDOH Solution for Employers will be available from both ProMedica and Kumanu.<br />"

Patients received either one or two doses of allogeneic bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells manufactured by Stemedica Cell Technologies at its Current Good Manufacturing Practice (cGMP) compliant California State-licensed facility. The first set of patients was treated with one dose of 100 million cells, and the second set received two doses of 50 million cells.<br />The stem cell treatment resulted in an improved clinical course for the patients. Within 24-48 hours of receiving the stem cells, all patients had a significant reduction in oxygen requirements. Several patients went from an inability to talk or eat due to shortness of breath to speaking in full sentences and eating full meals comfortably shortly after treatment.<br />The study also found improved inflammatory modulation. In fact, 88 percent of patients had a significant reduction in acute phase reactants, which are markers for reductions in inflammation. The subsequent reduction in inflammatory markers resulted in a reduced ‘cytokine storm’ in 88 percent of patients. Researchers noted that these patients experienced quicker extubation, less lung trauma and less oxygen toxicity.<br />The stem cell treatment also seemed to accelerate post-discharge recovery. At their one-month follow-up appointments, the patients who received stem cells improved at a faster rate than comparable patients not treated with stem cells. The stem cell treated patients were tolerating more activity, walking farther and not requiring home oxygen when evaluated at 30 days post discharge.<br />“It has been really exciting for ProMedica to conduct this innovative research, and we are very encouraged by the results. We’re eager to move into the next phase of the study because of the significant potential to help COVID-19 patients, in particular those who continue to experience lung damage after contracting the virus,” said Greg Kasper, vice president medical affairs, metro region, ProMedica. “The residual circulating stem cells end up residing in the lungs as a reservoir, which may lead to improved long-term lung health and a better quality of life post-COVID-19.”<br />ProMedica is working to secure funding to advance a Phase 2 study in conjunction with Stemedica, a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of progenitor cell and protein therapeutics for underserved medical conditions.<br />“We know that the immune-modulating properties of stem cells are quite remarkable in that they block the cytokine storm. COVID-19 offers a new frontier for exploring the potential benefits of stem cell therapy and, in particular, a clinical reduction of inflammation. The early findings and clinical outcomes of the study with ProMedica are encouraging, and we are hopeful to move into the next phase soon. Together, we have an opportunity to speed up the discovery of new treatments and potentially minimize the devastation of this pandemic,” said Nikolai Tankovich, president and chief medical officer, Stemedica.<br />"

The fund helps patients who find themselves in emergent financial need while they are receiving cancer care at the ProMedica Fostoria Community Hospital Cancer Center. Patient needs may include, but are not limited to, health supplies, medications, health equipment, rent, utilities, car payment, car insurance, dental care, and transportation to and from appointments. <br />The Jeff Shiff Run the Res Cancer Patient Support Fund is made possible by charitable contributions to the ProMedica Fostoria Community Hospital Foundation. The fund is named after its significant contributor: the ‘Run the Res.’  <br />For many years, Susie Shiff, along with her family, have hosted the annual Run the Res Jeff Shiff 5k and 10k Run/Walk and the Kids Fun Run, in memory of her husband, Jeff, who lost his battle to colon cancer in 2008. “The year after my husband passed away, my four children and I went to Athens, Ohio to do a half marathon. After that race, we wanted to keep his memory alive by creating a race in Fostoria around the reservoir we all love,” said Susie Shiff. The event has raised more than $50,000 for patients and families at the Fostoria Community Hospital Cancer and Infusion Center.<br />The 2020 race is rescheduled for April 18th, 2021. A portion of the proceeds will be donated to the Jeff Shiff Run the Res Cancer Patient Support Fund. To register or for more information, call Susie Shiff at 419-435-1772.<br />“It is difficult enough to cope with a diagnosis of cancer without the added burden of financial stress that can occur as a result,” said Kim Partin at ProMedica Fostoria Community Hospital Foundation. “We’re pleased to be able to partner with our community to provide cancer patients with much needed support.”<br />For questions about the Jeff Shiff Run the Res Cancer Patient Support Fund, please call the Fostoria Community Hospital Cancer Center at 419-436-6626.<br />"

Therefore, we have decided to respond to UToledo’s request for proposal. Our proposal presents a model for the joint operation of UTMC by UToledo and ProMedica that would enable UTMC to become financially sustainable. Under the model, UToledo would maintain ownership and ultimate control of UTMC, and ProMedica would provide management and other services.<br />Though publicly sharing our intentions this early in the process is not standard, we felt it was important to do so to ensure maximum openness and transparency. ProMedica proposes to:<br />Maintain UTMC as a vital asset for the community – by continuing to provide healthcare services including primary care, emergency care, cardiology, neurology, and orthopaedics on the campus of UTMC.<br />Quickly stabilize UToledo’s financial concerns related to UTMC – by utilizing ProMedica’s local healthcare management expertise and resources. <br />Address desperately needed care identified in our community health assessment – by growing the hospital with investments in service lines, including primary, behavioral health, and psychiatric care.<br />Retain high-quality State of Ohio jobs in our community – by UToledo employees remaining state employees with the benefits that go along with that designation, including state health care, state retirement plans, tuition reimbursement, seniority and others.<br />Replace UTMC’s obsolete electronic medical record (EMR) system – by utilizing ProMedica’s existing relationships and experience in designing and implementing industry-leading, cost-effective EMR solutions that meet regulatory standards. <br />Support the UToledo College of Medicine mission – by continuing to offer academic and research opportunities at UTMC.<br />Preserve UToledo’s oversight of UTMC – by using a joint operating model that ensures UToledo will maintain ultimate control of UTMC and continue making important decisions that impact the health and well-being of South Toledo. <br />A neutral third-party advisor is expected to review proposal submissions and make recommendations to the University of Toledo Board of Trustees. We appreciate the opportunity to put forth a forward-thinking solution that we sincerely believe will offer the greatest benefit to our community. <br />"

The change is in accordance with guidance from the Michigan governor’s office and the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services. <br />The health system has a three-tiered hospital visitor restriction policy in the event of a pandemic. Since March, it had been implementing a level 3 visitor restriction, which is its strictest level. Effective immediately, ProMedica hospitals and outpatient surgery facilities in Michigan will shift to a level 2 visitor restriction. <br />ProMedica Level 2 Visitor Restrictions Highlights:<br />For adult patients who are not COVID-19 suspect or confirmed, the following visitor guidelines apply:<br />    One designated visitor over the age of 18 will be permitted for the duration of the hospital stay.<br />    Visitors will be screened upon arrival for symptoms of acute respiratory illness, and those with symptoms will not be permitted to enter the facility.<br />    A visitor under the age of 18 may be allowed if he/she is the parent of a minor child.<br />All visitors who meet the above criteria must:<br />    Wear a mask at all times<br />    Practice appropriate cough etiquette<br />    Maintain appropriate social distancing<br />For adult patients who are COVID-19 suspect or confirmed, no visitors are permitted inside of the patients’ rooms. However, alternative mechanisms for patient and visitor interactions, such as video-call applications on cell phones or tablets, are offered.<br />Exceptions for extenuating circumstances are possible and would be determined on a case-by-case basis. <br />ProMedica will continue to monitor the evolving COVID-19 pandemic closely and make any appropriate adjustments to visitor restrictions to comply with state requirements or ordinances and to help ensure the safety of all in its facilities.<br />For more details about ProMedica’s current visitor restrictions, including those for specialty areas, <a href='https://www.promedica.org/Pages/COVID-19-Visitors.aspx#visitors'>click here.</a><br />"

Over the past couple of months, our system has learned a great deal about treating COVID-19, and we are well-prepared to do so safely in specially designated areas at all of our hospitals. That’s why we decided that it was time to transition Bay Park Hospital back to normal operations.”<br />The first step in transitioning Bay Park Hospital to normal operations was to routinely treat and admit COVID-19 positive and suspected positive adult patients at their local ProMedica hospitals starting on May 14. Soon after, Bay Park Hospital began accepting non-COVID-19 admissions.<br />“We have taken a systematic, phased-in approach to resuming normal hospital operations,” said Dr. Ravi Narra, vice president of medical affairs at ProMedica Bay Park Hospital. “Just as we strategically designated Bay Park Hospital as the centralized COVID-19 facility, we have been very thoughtful about returning to normal operations.”<br />The next step was to re-open surgery services at Bay Park Hospital. Consistent with state guidelines, Bay Park is performing all essential surgeries and non-essential surgeries that do not require an overnight stay. Ambulatory diagnostic testing capabilities at Bay Park Hospital resumed on May 18. These include non-time sensitive fluoroscopy, mammograms, ultrasound, DEXA, and lung cancer screenings.<br />ProMedica Physicians’ offices in the Bay Park Medical Office Building that were impacted by the hospital’s COVID-19 designation began re-opening for in-person visits over the past few weeks. This week, the final offices, including ProMedica Physicians Obstetrics and Gynecology – Oregon and ProMedica Physicians Cardiology – Oregon re-opened.<br />“Thank you to everyone who has supported our staff and patients during this challenging time,” said Buskey. While the pandemic is not over, we are hopeful about our path forward as a health system and as a community. With the lessons learned and a strengthened sense of purpose, our staff at all of our hospitals stand ready to deliver safe, compassionate, quality care for all severe injuries and illnesses.”<br />"

The new hospital opening date for patient care is September 24, 2020.<br />ProMedica has re-assessed the Hickman facility and design, and decided to add state-of-the-art precautionary measures to provide a safe, healthy environment for all patients and employees. These measures include increasing the number of negative pressure patient care rooms in the emergency department and the labor and delivery, critical care, and medical/surgical care units; installing plexiglass barriers at patient registration and in areas where high volumes might tend to congregate; and incorporating ultra-violet lights into the air ducts, which helps to disinfect the heating and cooling units and reduce the spread of germs.<br />ProMedica is leveraging the lessons learned from the recent pandemic to help ensure a safe environment for staff and patients going forward. By implementing the new measures, the hospital will be better prepared to respond to COVID-19 and similar outbreaks should it need to do so in the future. <br />"

The VQI operates 14 vascular registries.<br />The participation awards program began in 2016 to encourage active participation in the registries program and recognize the importance of that participation.<br />Participating centers can earn up to three stars based on actions that lead to better patient care, including: <br />    The completeness of long-term, follow-up reporting, based on the percentage of patients for whom they have at least nine months of follow-up data<br />    Physician attendance at semi-annual meetings of a regional quality group<br />    Initiation of quality improvement activities based on VQI data<br />    The number of vascular registries in which the center participates<br />VQI’s registries contain demographic, clinical, procedural and outcomes data from more than 670,000 vascular procedures performed in the U.S. and Canada. Each record includes information from the patient’s initial hospitalization and at one-year follow-up. <br />The wealth of data allows centers and providers to compare their performance to regional and national benchmarks. All centers and providers receive biannual dashboards and regular performance reports, so they can use their data to support quality improvement initiatives. <br />“Our team uses VQI data for all of our quality improvement projects. It is an extremely valuable tool that provides real-time feedback on the impact of our programs,” said Gregory Kasper, MD, FACS, MBA, vice president of medical affairs – metro region at ProMedica and president and chief medical officer of Jobst Vascular Institute at ProMedica Toledo Hospital. “Educationally, we use VQI for continued faculty development and feedback for our trainees. I can’t imagine trying to run a service line without this type of ongoing outcomes assessment.”<br />Biannual regional meetings allow physicians of different specialties, nurses, data managers, quality officers and others to meet, share information and ideas, and learn from each other in a positive and supportive environment. Members have used VQI data to significantly improve the delivery of vascular care at local, regional, and national levels, reducing complications and expenses.<br />“Hard-working, dedicated organizations such as the Jobst Vascular Institute at ProMedica Toledo Hospital are key to the success of the vascular registries,” said VQI Medical Director Dr. Jens Eldrup-Jorgensen. “The work we do to build and maintain the registries for researcher use is crucial to health and outcomes for vascular patients. Like the old saying says, ‘if you can’t measure it, you can’t improve it.’”<br />"

The new facility will be the second location of the ProMedica Toledo Hospital emergency department. It is expected to be conveniently located on Anthony Wayne Trail near the I-475 Interchange.<br />“ProMedica’s metro area hospitals already treat a sizable number of patients from Maumee and the surrounding area,” said Dawn Buskey, President, Metro Region Acute Care at ProMedica.”Our new freestanding emergency department will bring the high-quality compassionate care they count on even closer to home.”<br />The freestanding emergency department will be fully equipped with state-of-the-art technology and resources, enabling patients to obtain CT scans, X-rays, ultrasounds, lab services, and more onsite as appropriate. Patients will be able to receive treatment for a range of emergency conditions, including chest pain, stroke, severe shortness of breath, trauma injuries, allergic reactions, severe gastrointestinal symptoms, seizures, severe pain, uncontrollable bleeding, broken bones, cuts, burns and more. Should a condition require additional advanced treatment, surgery or inpatient care, patients would be stabilized and transported to the top-rated, nationally recognized ProMedica Toledo Hospital main campus. <br />Additionally, the new facility will include an urgent care for minor injuries and illness. By combining a freestanding emergency department and urgent care within the same facility, patients will be able to quickly receive the most appropriate and cost-effective care at one location. <br />Pending final plan approvals, construction of the 11,000 square-foot facility is expected to begin in the summer of 2020 with a grand opening slated for the summer of 2021. Approximately two dozen jobs are expected to be created with the opening of the new facility, including those in the areas of nursing, registration and environmental services.<br />"

The designation recognizes Bixby Hospital’s efforts in protecting patients from harm and providing safer health care. The Leapfrog Group is a national nonprofit organization committed to improving health care quality and safety for consumers and purchasers. The Safety Grade assigns an ‘A’, ‘B’, ‘C’, ‘D’ or ‘F’ grade to hospitals across the country based on their performance in preventing medical errors, injuries, accidents, infections and other harms to patients in their care. <br />“We are honored to be formally recognized as a leader in patient safety, said Julie Yaroch, DO, president of ProMedica Bixby Hospital. The achievement recognizes the tireless efforts of our dedicated employees and providers, who continually strive to deliver the highest standard of care.”<br />Developed under the guidance of a <a href='http://www.leapfroggroup.org/about/expert-panelists'>national expert panel</a>, the Leapfrog Hospital Safety Grade uses 28 measures of publicly available hospital safety data to assign grades to more than 2,600 U.S. acute-care hospitals twice per year. Researchers found that when compared to “A” hospitals, patients at “D” and “F” hospitals face a 92% greater risk of avoidable death; patients at “C” hospitals on average face an 88% greater risk; and patients at “B” hospitals on average face a 35% greater risk. Overall, an estimated 160,000 lives are lost annually from the avoidable medical errors that are accounted for in the Leapfrog Hospital Safety Grade, a significant improvement from 2016, when researchers estimated 205,000 avoidable deaths. The Hospital Safety Grade’s methodology is peer-reviewed and fully transparent, and the results are free to the public.<br />“To be recognized nationally as an ‘A’ hospital is an accomplishment the whole community should take pride in,” said Leah Binder, president and CEO of The Leapfrog Group. “Hospitals that earn an ‘A’ grade are making it a priority to protect patients from preventable medical harm and error. We congratulate hospital leaders, board members, staff, volunteers and clinicians who work so hard to earn this A.”  <br />For more information about ProMedica Bixby Hospital, visit <a href='/location/promedica-bixby-hospital'>promedica.org/bixby.</a><br />"

Almost ninety-thousand guests attended from 39 different states. Five hundred and sixty-five community members volunteered, and 32 companies sponsored the series. Fifteen non-profit organizations benefitted by receiving a portion of beverage sales.<br />Planning for the 2020 ProMedica Summer Concert Series was well underway before the COVID-19 pandemic was declared. ProMedica would like to recognize the generous sponsors that had already pledged their support prior to the cancelation: Coors Light, City of Toledo, Fifth Third Bank, Great Lakes Sound, Hylant, iHeartRadio, Laibe Electric/Technology, Owens Corning, Paramount and Stevens Disposal.<br />“We understand how disappointing this announcement may be to the tens of thousands of supporters who look forward to the concert series every year,” said Moore. “But, because the concerts attract such large crowds, we believe canceling the series is the socially responsible decision. We’re hoping to bring the concerts back next summer.”<br />"

The hospital initially had 30 beds, with no maternity ward, intensive care unit, or special treatment areas. During the first few years of operation, the hospital had only 12 total personnel, including the superintendent, six registered nurses, one bookkeeper, one cook, one maid and one janitor. The hospital was named Fostoria City Hospital until the 1990s until it was renamed Fostoria Community Hospital. <br />Throughout the years Fostoria Community Hospital experienced many major changes, expansions and growth, including new hospital units, medical services and technology. A few most notable changes came in the 2000s. In 2000, the hospital became affiliated with ProMedica, ending its independent, public healthcare status and becoming a private hospital. In 2002, the hospital underwent it’s largest expansion which included a 30,000-square-foot addition on the south side of the hospital's emergency center, a brand new surgery department on the second floor, and upgraded radiology and diagnostic imaging capabilities. Then in 2003, Fostoria Community Hospital became designated as a Critical Access Hospital through a federal program that entitles small, rural hospitals to Medicare cost reimbursement.<br />While the hospital has seen enormous growth and change to its facility, the dedicated, compassionate care it provides to patients has not changed. “What makes Fostoria Community Hospital what it is today –  a strong, anchor institution – I think of the doctors, nurses and staff. The individuals working at the hospital are committed to the Fostoria community and caring for the people they call their neighbors,” says Tom Borer, vice president of operations, ProMedica  Fostoria Community Hospital. <br />“Patients in the community can trust that when they walk through the doors of Fostoria Community Hospital, they will be seen by compassionate, dedicated staff, many of which have worked at the hospital since the start of their career,” said Marsha Cushman, DO, chief of staff, ProMedica Fostoria Community Hospital.<br />Becky Bouillon, RN, community outreach coordinator, ProMedica Fostoria Community Hospital, has worked at the hospital for over 42 years. As a lifelong resident of Fostoria, she is proud to have found a career in the town where she grew up. “The family atmosphere and caring employees are what has made my career at Fostoria Community Hospital so special. The names, faces and uniforms have changed, but the community commitment and focus on patient health has not,” she said. “If I had to do it all over again, I would choose to be a nurse at this community hospital.”<br />“We’re really proud of our roots in the Fostoria community,” said Pam Jensen, president, regional acute care - Ohio and support services, ProMedica. “We understand that having access to high quality care is a critical part of a person’s health and well-being, and we’re always evaluating our programs and services to ensure we’re providing essential services to the community.”<br />Fostoria Community Hospital had a 90th anniversary celebration planned for staff and the community on May 11, 2020, but the hospital has postponed the gathering due to the Coronavirus. A new date will be determined later this year. <br />ProMedica Fostoria Community Hospital is a member of ProMedica, a mission-based, not-for-profit integrated healthcare organization headquartered in Toledo, Ohio. ProMedica serves communities in 28 states. The organization offers acute and ambulatory care, an insurance company with a dental plan, and post-acute and academic business lines. The organization has more than 56,000 employees, 13 hospitals, 2,100+ physicians and advanced practice providers with privileges, 900+ healthcare providers employed by ProMedica Physicians, a health plan, and nearly 400 assisted living facilities, skilled nursing and rehabilitation centers, memory care communities, outpatient rehabilitation clinics, and hospice and home health care agencies. Driven by its Mission to improve your health and well-being, ProMedica has been nationally recognized for its advocacy programs and efforts to address social determinants of health.

As a point of clarification, these masks are not for use during the direct care of a patient whose condition requires a mask. Instead, they will be used in general areas for patients, visitors and nonclinical staff. ProMedica wants to make them available to help keep all employees and our limited visitors safe. The community donation of these masks will enable us to provide masks for everyone in the general areas without depleting the hospital-acquired surgical masks that are needed for patients. All collected masks will be immediately sent to laundry/processing to be prepared for use. Surplus masks will be distributed to local organizations in need.<br />In accordance with the CDC recommendation, ProMedica is recommending that people wear homemade masks when in public. The general public should use homemade masks and reserve surgical masks and N95s for frontline healthcare workers, who are more at risk.<br /><a href='https://promedicahealthconnect.org/news-and-community/help-the-shortage-volunteers-needed-to-sew-fabric-face-masks/'>For details and sewing instructions, go to ProMedica HealthConnect </a><br />"

The ProMedica Impact Fund will help address needs that were already critical in so many communities, and are now being intensified by the COVID-19 crisis.<br />“The need to create a new model of health and well-being has been known for years, and it’s clear that we need a new path that addresses public health, primary care, mental health and major investments in SDOH,” said Randy Oostra, ProMedica President and CEO. “It’s never been more critical than it is now to direct significantly more resources to people’s basic needs. Now is the time for a major social impact in our country.”<br />ProMedica will leverage 10 years of expertise in addressing the underlying social and environmental effects on health and collaborating with community-based organizations to address issues like hunger, affordable housing, workforce development and education. <br />“Our belief is that The ProMedica Impact Fund is the right response, at the right time, being built with the right collaboration between national philanthropy and expanded local programs,” said Mr. Oostra.<br />ProMedica has set a goal of raising $1 billion in the next eight years to support this ongoing work to transform the health of communities.  <br />The PIF will invest in three categories of activities:<br />    Grants to not-for-profit agencies whose interventions and outcomes are aligned with the SDOH model for improvement of individual and community health. <br />    Creation and scaling of standardized national metrics and data-tracking to align organizations working on critical SDOH initiatives. <br />    Seed capital in new businesses and/or agencies that are mission-aligned with the PIF goals.<br />This year, the PIF will launch in select U.S. cities, with the intention to quickly expand to other communities around the nation.<br />“ProMedica is a national health and well-being organization with a proven track record in advancing SDOH initiatives,” Mr. Oostra said. “We will forge new partnerships in philanthropy and local interventions to expedite how individuals and communities recover from the personal and economic impact of this disease.”  <br />Learn more about how ProMedica is addressing the <a href='https://www.promedica.org/socialdeterminants/Pages/default.aspx'>Social Determinants of Health.</a><br />"

One such transition relates to Bay Park’s labor and delivery unit, which will accommodate the system’s suspected/confirmed COVID-19 maternity patients that may deliver in the near future.<br />To that end, ProMedica is contacting all current patients who previously pre-registered to deliver at Bay Park in the coming weeks. The health system is working with those patients to identify options to deliver at another ProMedica hospital, specifically ProMedica Flower or ProMedica Memorial (Fremont) Hospitals, as well as ProMedica Toledo Hospital. These hospitals are within 20-30 minutes of Bay Park and offer outstanding clinical care and exceptional, family-centered experiences for mom and baby.<br />ProMedica is looking forward to caring for these expectant mothers and appreciates their understanding as we continue to navigate through the COVID-19 pandemic as a community.<br />Read more about ProMedica and COVID-19 <br />"

Over the past month, our coronavirus incident management team has been meeting and communicating daily with all local, CDC and WHO officials to ensure that we have a plan and resources in place should the new coronavirus come to this region. Our system is continuing to take aggressive steps to minimize the spread of the new coronavirus disease (COVID-19). We are here to provide the very best care to our patients, especially in challenging times when the sickest, weakest and most fragile need us the most. We take that responsibility seriously. If we need to reschedule your appointment or limit visitors to all our facilities in coming days and weeks, know that this is because we are trying to protect those in our care.<br />We realize that this is unprecedented for our community. We also know that rumors and social media can frequently increase anxiety and stress. We are working hard to communicate clearly and proactively. I am proud of our ProMedica employees and their commitment. At every level of our organization, our team is dedicated and focused on improving the health and well-being of the people we serve. <br />Sincerely,<br /><img alt src='/assets/images/news/content-images/randy-oostra.png' /> <br /> <br />Randy Oostra<br /><a>Read more about ProMedica and COVID-19 </a><br />"

The distinction places Toledo Hospital in the top one percent of more than 4,500 hospitals assessed nationwide for its consistent, year-over-year superior clinical performance as measured by Healthgrades, a national organization that analyzes the performance of hospitals across the country.<br />ProMedica continuously strives to build and maintain a culture of safety, clinical excellence and exceptional patient experiences.  “When we live by our Mission and values, we create an environment that is centered around our patients,' said Dawn Buskey, president of ProMedica Toledo and Russell J. Ebeid Children's Hospitals. 'As one of America's 50 Best Hospitals, we will continue to foster a safe, healing environment for our patients and communities, and create and implement best practices we can share with hospitals across the nation.' <br />“The recipients of the Healthgrades America’s 50 Best Hospitals Award are committed to high quality standards throughout the entire organization,” said Brad Bowman, MD, Chief Medical Officer at Healthgrades. “We congratulate the recipients of this award as they provide the best care possible for their patients.” <br />From 2016 through 2018, patients treated in hospitals achieving the award had, on average, a 27.1 percent lower risk of dying than if they were treated in hospitals that did not receive the award, as measured across 19 rated conditions and procedures for which mortality is the outcome.* <br />During that same period, if all hospitals performed similarly to those achieving the Healthgrades America's 50 Best Hospitals Award, 188,768 lives could potentially have been saved. For example, patients treated for heart failure at a hospital that achieved the award had, on average, a 33.8 percent lower risk of dying during their hospital stay than if treated at a hospital that did not receive the award.*<br />Toledo Hospital also has been named one of Healthgrades 100 Best Hospitals for Cardiac Care, General Surgery, Joint Replacement, Pulmonary Care and Gastrointestinal Care. <br />Recipients of the Healthgrades America’s 50 Best Hospitals Award stand out among the rest for overall clinical excellence across a broad spectrum of care. During the 2020 study period (2016 through 2018), these hospitals showed superior performance in clinical outcomes for patients in the Medicare population across at least 21 of 32 most common inpatient conditions and procedures — as measured by objective performance data (risk-adjusted mortality and in-hospital complications). <br />To learn more about how Healthgrades determines award recipients, and for more information on Healthgrades Quality Solutions, please visit www.healthgrades.com/quality.<br />"

Ebeid and his family for their extensive generosity to ProMedica and for their compassion to help children.<br />Dawn Buskey, president of ProMedica Toledo and Russell J. Ebeid Children's Hospitals said, “Philanthropist Russell J. Ebeid dedicated much of his life to helping others. We’re honored that our children’s hospital now carries his name in memory of his impact on community health. Mr. Ebeid’s generosity helped ProMedica establish Ebeid Hospice Residence, ProMedica Ebeid Institute and ProMedica Ebeid Neighborhood Promise.”<br />In addition to the name, significant renovations were made to the hospital to help bring a new era of pediatric care to Toledo. <br />The renovations include:<br />    A new pediatric intensive care unit with 15 private rooms that provide plenty of space for patients, family members and caregivers. These rooms have pullout couches for parents to provide comfort and better sleeping conditions when they are with their children.<br />    Updated, large pediatric acute care rooms.<br />    Easier access to the helipad for pediatric critical care transfers.<br />    A new pediatric inpatient gym that provides the space and equipment necessary for patients to rehabilitate.<br />    An uplifting, child-friendly environment to promote healing.<br />“Our children’s hospital is committed to giving children the best possible care in a place that’s just for them. A dedicated pediatric emergency room, kid-friendly diagnostics and exceptional pediatric chronic care management are a few of the ways we put children and their families first. And, because we’re accredited by the Joint Commission, you know your child is in the best hands,” said Paula Grieb, chief nursing officer, ProMedica Metro Region. <br />"

Sickle cell disease is a group of inherited red blood cell disorders, which often leads to serious health problems.<br />The Adult Sickle Cell Clinic provides comprehensive treatment including transfusions, pain management and exemplary care for adults. <br />ProMedica Toledo Children’s Hospital will continue to treat children for the disease. <br />Crawford Strunk, MD, pediatric hematologist and oncologist at Toledo Children’s Hospital, said there is a need for pediatric patients to transition to adult care smoothly. “It’s important to have a continuity of care as pediatric patients become adults. Their medical needs change and they are also glad to visit an adult office instead of a pediatric office in their 20s.”<br />Only a few adult sickle cell clinics exist nationally and they report reduced emergency center visits, hospitalizations, and a reduced rate of long-term complications. Dr. Strunk said, “Nationally, there are not a lot of medical providers with the experience or expertise to care for patients with sickle cell disease.”  <br />The clinic is staffed by the ProMedica Toledo Hospital Medical Oncology Outpatient Infusion office, Dr. Strunk and Jobst Vascular physician, Drew Oostra, MD.  <br />Dr. Oostra said, “We started this clinic to provide care for patients with sickle cell disease who do not currently have a medical provider for their disease or who feel that their care could be improved.  We are also taking referrals from current providers who feel patients would benefit from a comprehensive care setting.'<br />"

Main St., Suite 5, Bowling Green, Ohio and 2751 Bay Park Drive, Suite 209, Oregon, Ohio. <br /><br /><br /><br />The ProMedica Physicians Wood County School Consortium Health Clinics are open six days a week, Monday through Saturday, with extended hours three days a week. About 4,000 plan members, which includes employees and their families, will be able to access the services at the health clinics.<br /><br /><br /><br />Kent Bishop, MD, chief medical officer ProMedica physicians and acute care stated, “As healthcare adapts and changes, we need to think differently about how to manage the health and well-being of specific populations.” <br /><br /><br /><br />The clinics provide a wide array of additional services beyond a traditional primary care office. They include services such as wellness programs, routine testing and labs, nutrition counseling and medically integrated fitness programs.<br /><br /><br /><br />“We first heard of such a program at a conference about four years ago. We’ve been working on bringing it to Wood County. It’s a great asset to employees, especially in rural regions. As superintendents, we desire to provide great services and have a healthy workforce,” said Adam Koch, superintendent, Otsego Local Schools.<br /><br /><br /><br />The health clinics also have some potential cost-saving benefits compared to urgent care and emergency room visits. “We are always mindful of cost-savings initiatives. This is a win-win situation,” said Brent Welker, superintendent, Eastwood Local Schools.<br /><br /><br /><br />Both superintendents have received positive feedback about the clinics from employees and their families. Welker stated, “My daughter used one of the clinics before she went back to college after winter break. The scheduling was easy and convenient and she was pleased with the experience.”<br /><br /><br /><br />These health clinics exemplify ProMedica’s vision to create communities where all individuals reach their highest potential for health.<br /><br /> <br />"

Ebeid Children’s Hospital that focuses on youth violence prevention among teens, was again awarded a grant through the Ohio Department of Health. This grant cycle, beginning Feb. 1, will reflect new requirements issued by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).<br /> <br /> Established in 1995, Teen PEP focuses on sexual-violence prevention education as well as teen dating violence and bullying prevention. The project is based on the CDC-evaluated, evidence-based curriculum Expect Respect: A School-Based Program Promoting Safe and Healthy Relationships for Youth, and integrates concepts from Safe Dates. The goal of the program is to train students as teen leaders to reduce the incidence of sexual violence in northwest Ohio.<br /> <br /> Danielle Cisterino-Hajdu, project director of the Teen PEP program said, “I’m proud to report that the Teen Pep program has some remarkable results. Statistically, 1 in 3 women and 1 in 4 men report being sexually assaulted between the ages of 11 and 17. Program participants demonstrate an increase of up to 60 percent in knowledge related to sexual assault prevention.”<br /> <br /> The CDC is shifting the focus from lesson-driven activities to having the students develop policy and action plans for unsafe areas at schools. <br /> <br /> The program will now include more adult professional hospital and program staff to support and guide the youth-led services. These services will focus on awareness, education and action planning around unsafe zones in schools where bullying and other forms of harassment and/or violence might be taking place. Additionally, teens will lead the development of messaging campaigns to create healthy cultural norms for their peers.<br /> <br /> Teen PEP experts will train youth leaders on how to be change agents in their community. Cisterino-Hajdu explains, “The Ohio Department of Health wants us to build strong relationships and be a presence in our partnering schools, working with select groups of youth leaders to form healthy cultural norms that help prevent sexual violence and teen dating violence specifically.”<br /> <br /> For more information about ProMedica, visit <a href='/service-to-the-community/teen-pep'>www.promedica.org/TeenPep</a>.<br /> <br />"

He is specialty trained to perform building area searches,<br />scent tracking, staff protection and firearms detection on command. He is also<br />trained in pet therapy and will serve in a therapeutic role. As a loving,<br />approachable canine, he will provide compassion to the people he encounters. He<br />is the first canine to come on board, with plans to bring in two additional<br />canines over the next two years.<br />Brad Conner, ProMedica administrative<br />director of security, voice operations &amp; disaster management, said, “Jozef<br />was brought in as a preventative measure. He is a working dog who will respond<br />to the commands of his handler, Officer Nick Buchan.  They will be seen walking the hallways<br />throughout various ProMedica hospitals but will spend the majority of the time<br />at ProMedica Toledo Hospital.  Jozef will<br />not be a stranger in the ProMedica Toledo Children’s Hospital, where children<br />can pet him, allowing him to help create a more comfortable environment for<br />them.”<br />All patient visits are<br />pre-scheduled and special care is taken when introducing the dog, including<br />distributing collector cards with Jozef’s picture and information.<br />ProMedica is a mission-based, not-for-profit integrated healthcare organization headquartered in Toledo, Ohio.

Mammography is a specific type of imaging test that uses a low-dose X-ray system to examine breasts. A mammography exam, called a mammogram, is used to aid in the early detection and diagnosis of breast diseases in women. <br />“Fostoria Community Hospital is proud to be an ACR accredited and trusted site for patients receiving radiology services such as mammography,” said Nathan Egbert, MD, medical director of radiology at Fostoria Community Hospital. “Providing the highest level of image quality and safety is a top priority, as we know mammograms are critical for an early detection of breast cancer.”<br />The ACR gold seal of accreditation represents the highest level of image quality and patient safety. It is awarded only to facilities meeting ACR Practice Parameters and Technical Standards after a peer-review evaluation by board-certified physicians and medical physicists who are experts in the field. Image quality, personnel qualifications, adequacy of facility equipment, quality control procedures and quality assurance programs are assessed. The findings are reported to the ACR Committee on Accreditation, which subsequently provides the practice with a comprehensive report that can be used for continuous practice improvement. <br />The ACR, founded in 1924, is a professional medical society dedicated to serving patients and society by empowering radiology professionals to advance the practice, science and professions of radiological care. The College serves more than 37,000 diagnostic/interventional radiologists, radiation oncologists, nuclear medicine physicians, and medical physicists with programs focusing on the practice of medical imaging and radiation oncology and the delivery of comprehensive health care services.<br />For more information about ProMedica Fostoria Community Hospital, visit <a href='/location/promedica-fostoria-community-hospital'>www.promedica.org/fostoria</a>. <br />ProMedica Fostoria Community Hospital is a member of ProMedica, a mission-based, not-for-profit integrated healthcare organization headquartered in Toledo, Ohio.

It is the first urgent care organization in northwest Ohio to earn the recognition.<br />ProMedica Urgent Care’s seven centers provide patients with walk-in, extended-hour medical attention for a large scope of medical conditions. As part of the accreditation, the centers have met all of the Urgent Care Association’s established standards and criteria for quality of patient care, safety, and scope of services.<br />When a patient’s regular doctor cannot address a medical condition promptly – such as unexpected cuts, sprains or fractures that do not require a visit to the emergency department, ProMedica Urgent Care’s centers provide a convenient and viable treatment option. The centers are all equipped with x-ray, laboratory services, and licensed providers who are always available to perform minor procedures like splinting and suturing.<br />Urgent care fills the gap between primary care and hospital emergency rooms, offering increased convenience and cost savings. By participating in the accreditation process, ProMedica Urgent Care and the Urgent Care Association demonstrate their commitment toward providing patients with access to quality care of the highest level.<br />ProMedica Urgent Care accepts unscheduled, walk-in patients 8 a.m. – 8 p.m., 365 days a year.<br />For more information about ProMedica Urgent Care, visit www.promedica.org/urgentcare.<br />ProMedica is a mission-based, not-for-profit integrated healthcare organization headquartered in Toledo, Ohio.

TCAR is a clinically proven, minimally invasive approach for high surgical risk patients who need carotid artery treatment.<br />Carotid artery disease is a form of atherosclerosis, or a buildup of plaque, in the two main arteries in the neck that supply oxygen-rich blood to the brain. If left untreated, carotid artery disease can often lead to stroke; it is estimated to be the source of stroke in up to a third of cases, with 400,000 new diagnoses of the disease made every year in the U.S. alone.<br /> “TCAR is an important new option in the fight against stroke, and is particularly suited for the large portion of patients we see who are at higher risk of complications from carotid surgery due to age, anatomy, or other medical conditions,” said Sophie Afridi, MD, ProMedica Physicians Vascular Surgeon. “Because of its low stroke risk and faster patient recovery, I believe TCAR represents the future of carotid repair.”<br />TCAR is unique in that blood flow is temporarily reversed during the procedure so that any small bits of plaque that may break off are diverted away from the brain, preventing a stroke from happening. A small incision in the neck is done to limit the pathway the wire has to travel, minimizing the risk of stroke. A stent is then placed inside the artery to stabilize the plaque.<br />Prior to TCAR, the main treatment option for severe carotid artery disease was an open surgical procedure called carotid endarterectomy (CEA). CEA removes plaque from inside the carotid artery to restore normal blood flow to the brain, but the large incision leaves a visible scar the length of the neck and carries risks of surgical complications that can cause issues with swallowing, speaking and sensation in the face. <br />For more information about ProMedica, visit <a href='/'>www.promedica.org.</a><br />ProMedica Toledo Hospital is a member ProMedica is a mission-based, not-for-profit integrated healthcare organization headquartered in Toledo, Ohio.

Mr. Oostra also has been chosen by the national Board of Selectors as the local winner to represent Toledo at the Jefferson Awards national ceremony in Washington D.C. in June 2019.<br /> <br />As President and CEO of ProMedica since 2008, Mr. Oostra is known for challenging the status quo of traditional health care. Believing that healthier people create healthier communities, he has driven corporate and personal responsibility within ProMedica to support decisions and investments that are aligned with the betterment of the entire community.<br /> <br />Mr. Oostra was one of the first healthcare leaders in the nation to acknowledge and embrace the need for the healthcare industry to look beyond the walls of hospitals and physicians’ offices to address the social determinants of health (SDOH). Understanding that the conditions in which people are born, live, work and play impact about 80 percent of a person’s health and well-being, he led the development of a comprehensive SDOH risk identification and intervention model that has touched the lives of more than two million ProMedica patients since 2014.<br /> <br />Additionally, Mr. Oostra has been instrumental in the movement to redevelop and revitalize Toledo’s downtown core. Bringing together like-minded business and civic leaders from around the region, he played a major role in the creation of the 22nd Century Committee, now ConnecToledo, which is a cross-sector group that provides leadership and drive the development of a strategic plan for downtown Toledo’s future identity.<br /> <br />The Jefferson Awards were founded in 1972 by Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, Senator Robert Taft Jr., and Sam Beard as a national awards platform focused on extraordinary achievement in public service. For nearly 50 years, The Jefferson Awards have consistently celebrated, elevated and recognized individuals who build better communities and contribute to better a future for those around them.<br /> <br />For more information about ProMedica, visit <a href='/'>www.promedica.org</a>.<br /> <br />ProMedica is a mission-based, not-for-profit integrated healthcare organization headquartered in Toledo, Ohio.

Recently gaining FDA approval, the WEB device is used to treat wide neck bifurcation aneurysms in certain areas of the brain.<br />A <a href='/services-and-conditions/'>brain aneurysm</a> is an abnormal bulging or ballooning of a blood vessel in the brain called an artery. An estimated six million people in the United States have an unruptured brain aneurysm. <br />The device is made from ultra-fine wires braided together to form a flexible self-expanding mesh. When placed inside the aneurysm sac, the WEB device’s proprietary microbraid technology disrupts blood flow to treat challenging aneurysms that often require multiple implants with a single device. Additional benefits include: <br />    Avoids stent placement in the brain's arterial system.<br />    Provides an alternative therapy to open brain surgery for those previously unable to be treated minimally invasively. <br />    May reduce medication required post-procedure.<br />“This new device is a game changer for patients with complex brain aneurysms. Prior to this major advent in endovascular therapy, treatment was far more risky and difficult for those patients,” says <a href='https://www.promedica.org/provider/syed-zaidi-md-neurology'>Syed Zaidi, MD,</a> Medical Director, Interventional Neurology Program, ProMedica Toledo Hospital. “Together with The University of Toledo College of Medicine, Toledo Hospital has become a leading site for aneurysm treatment.”<br />Since it’s launch in March, NeuroEndovasular Surgeons and assistant professors of neurology at UTCoM, Drs. Mouhammad Jumaa, Syed Zaidi and Richard Burgess, have performed six successful procedures with this device. <a href='/services-and-conditions/brain-aneurysm'>Toledo Hospital</a> is the first comprehensive stroke center to offer this new treatment modality in Northern Ohio and Michigan.<br />Watch Dr. Zaidi explain how the device works in the video below with WTOL:<br /><iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/S_r8ASoEPU0?enablejsapi=1'></iframe><br />For more information about ProMedica, visit <a href='/'>www.promedica.org</a>.<br />ProMedica is a mission-based, not-for-profit integrated healthcare organization headquartered in Toledo, Ohio.

Also required are procedures in place for follow-up patient care, such as counseling and smoking cessation programs.<br />“The American Cancer Society estimates there will be over 140,000 deaths from lung cancer this year,” Nathan Egbert, MD, radiologist at Memorial Hospital. “Our goal at Memorial Hospital is to lower this number. Deaths caused by lung cancer can be decreased by quitting smoking and through routine screening in patients who are at high risk of developing lung cancer.”<br />Lung cancer screening with low-dose computed tomography scans, and appropriate follow-up care, significantly reduces lung cancer deaths. In December 2013, the United States Preventive Services Task Force recommended screening of adults aged 55 to 80 years who have a 30 pack-year smoking history and currently smoke or have quit within the past 15 years. Lung cancer is the nation’s leading cancer killer – taking the lives of more people each year than breast, colon and prostate cancers combined <br />The ACR, founded in 1924, is one of the largest and most influential medical associations in the United States. The ACR devotes its resources to making imaging and radiation therapy safe, effective and accessible to those who need it. Its 36,000 members include radiologists, radiation oncologists, medical physicists, interventional radiologists and nuclear medicine physicians.<br />For more information about Memorial Hospital, visit <a href='/location/promedica-memorial-hospital'>www.promedica.org/memorial</a>.<br />ProMedica Memorial Hospital is a member of ProMedica, a mission-based, not-for-profit integrated healthcare organization headquartered in Toledo, Ohio.

This is the third Food Clinic location, with two others at the Center for Health Services and the ProMedica Health and Wellness Center.<br />The new location will be open on Thursdays and will provide food to patients in need of healthy food at home. In 2018, over 1,600 ProMedica patients in the Bay Park region screened positive for food insecurity. Patients screening positive can receive a referral from a ProMedica primary care provider to visit the Food Clinic at any of the three locations.  <br />“The opening of ProMedica’s third Food Clinic location is just one way for us expand our reach in the community and to continue addressing food insecurity and ensuring people have access to healthy food,” said Kate Sommerfeld, President, Social Determinants of Health at ProMedica.<br />The ProMedica Food Clinic launched in April 2015 as a commitment to addressing food insecurity as one of the many social determinants of health in the community. The idea of the Food Clinic is “food is medicine.” Patients can shop for two to three days’ worth of food for their household per visit, once per month for up to six months, at which time patients can return to their provider for another referral if needed.<br />Patients are able to choose their own foods from the clinic, alongside an expert who considers the patient’s needs, health conditions and lifestyle. In addition, patients can receive nutrition counseling from a dietitian, nutrition education from a dietetic technician, healthy recipes, and connection to community resources. Since opening in 2015, the Food Clinics have served more than 6,600 unique households through more than 28,000 patient visits. <br />For more information about ProMedica Bay Park Hospital, visit <a href='/location/promedica-bay-park-hospital'>www.promedica.org/baypark.</a><br />ProMedica Bay Park Hospital is a member of ProMedica, a mission-based, not-for-profit integrated healthcare organization headquartered in Toledo, Ohio.

They will perform 16 haircuts in four rounds inspired by styles through the decades from the 1950s to 2000s, and they will participate in a final round inspired by works in the TMA collection.<br />These predominantly African American barbershops are among the participants in ProMedica’s Barbershop Health and Wellness Program, which provides barbers with education on prostate cancer and other screenings as well as health educational materials they can distribute to their clients.<br />In 2018, ProMedica’s Health and Wellness program expanded to address the significant health disparities of African American men as reported in the recent Lucas County Health Needs Assessments and the Ohio State Health Improvement Plan. These reports reveal health disparities in the African American male community with regard to heart disease, diabetes, prostate and colorectal cancer. Representatives will discuss these health disparities during the event.<br />“The barbershop program is about fostering trusting relationships between the community and healthcare providers while providing health screenings, health education, and resource information,” explained ProMedica Cancer Institute Community Liaison Robin Charney, who leads the program. “The response from the participating barbers has been phenomenal. They have the ear and the trust of the community and have allowed us to expand our health education and screening efforts.”<br />“Events like Art of the Cut celebrate those community connections,” Charney said. “Art presents us with an opportunity to bring the community closer, and every encounter we have with each other is an opportunity for wellness.”<br />The Art of the Cut is sponsored by Circle, a Museum affinity group whose diverse, civically, and culturally engaged members work with TMA and other community organizations to develop new, innovative ways of connecting the Toledo community with the Museum and art.<br />“The positive effect that art can have on health is often overlooked,” explained TMA Leadership Fellow Alyssa Greenberg. “The event positions art as something that is a positive social good; art is for everyone; art is even for people who think art is not for me. For the barbers, their effectiveness as community leaders and men's wellness advocates has everything to do with their capacity as artists.”<br />Les Levesque from Tal Mon, one of the Barbershop Program participants, is looking forward to participating in The Art of the Cut because of its potential to create connections.<br />“We live in a divided society, so this is an important opportunity to bring people together for a cause,” Levesque said. “Health and haircuts are two things that everyone needs so it was a natural fit to help educate my clients and the community about health screenings.”<br />Joining Levesque as co-hosts at the event are Jamal Grant (Da Shop), Tawann Gaston (Groomed), Stacey Fletcher (Fletcher's), Steve Parker (Steve's Sport-n-Cuts), and James Foster (James Foster).<br />About Toledo Museum of Art<br />Since its founding in 1901, the Toledo Museum of Art has earned a global reputation for the quality of our collection, our innovative and extensive education programs, and our architecturally significant campus. And thanks to the benevolence of its founders, as well as the continued support of its members, TMA remains a privately endowed, non-profit institution and opens its collection to the public, free of charge.

    "content": "<br />ProMedica Toledo Hospital cardiac cath lab recognized for excellence Press Release<br />ProMedica Toledo Hospital cardiac cath lab recognized for excellence<br />The American College of Cardiology has recognized <a href='/location/promedica-toledo-hospital'>ProMedica Toledo Hospital</a> for its demonstrated expertise and commitment in treating patients who come to a cardiac cath lab for care, including diagnostic catheterization and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) procedures. Toledo Hospital was awarded the Cardiac Cath Lab Accreditation with PCI in August based on rigorous onsite evaluation of the staff’s ability to evaluate, diagnose and treat patients who come to the cardiac cath lab.<br />PCI is also known as coronary angioplasty. It is a procedure that opens narrowed or blocked coronary arteries with a balloon to relieve symptoms of heart disease or reduce heart damage during or after a heart attack. Hospitals that have proven exceptional competence in treating patients who require cardiac catheterization have standardized their assessment process for patients before undergoing catheterization to ensure quality and patient safety. They ensure that care in the procedure room for sedation, infection control, radiation safety, universal protocol, and time out procedures is fully coordinated. They have also mastered the appropriate transfer to a cath recovery unit to better monitor and track complications, enhance physician-to-patient communication, patient family communication, discharge instructions and follow-up information.<br />Hospitals receiving Cardiac Cath Lab Accreditation with PCI from ACC must take part in a multifaceted clinical process that involves: completing a gap analysis; examining variances of care; developing an action plan; a rigorous onsite interview; and monitoring for sustained success. Improved methods and strategies of caring for patients include streamlining processes, implementation guidelines and standards, and adopting best practices in the care of cath lab patients. Facilities that achieve accreditation meet or exceed an array of stringent criteria and have organized a team of doctors, nurses, clinicians and other administrative staff that earnestly support the efforts leading to improved patient outcomes.<br />“Our physicians, care providers and staff members are pleased to be recognized as one of only 13 cath labs in the United States, and the only one in Ohio, to be awarded with this accreditation,” said Praveen Tamirisa, MD, president, ProMedica Heart Institute. “Our physicians and clinicians are dedicated to improving the care for patients who need cardiac interventions through standardized processes to improve patient outcomes.” The ACC offers U.S. and international hospitals like Toledo Hospital access to a comprehensive suite of cardiac accreditation services designed to optimize patient outcomes and improve hospital financial performance. These services are focused on all aspects of cardiac care, including the cath lab.<br />ProMedica is a mission-based, not-for-profit integrated healthcare organization headquartered in Toledo, Ohio. It serves communities in 30 states. The organization offers acute and ambulatory care, an insurance company with a dental plan, and post-acute and academic business lines.

    "content": "<br />Total Hip Replacement - Anterior Approach Press Release<br />Total Hip Replacement â€“ Anterior Approach<br />The anterior approach hip replacement refers to a minimally invasive surgical technique done from the front of the hip. Since the technique does not cut muscle or tendons, it reduces the risk of injury to muscles, soft tissue, tendons, vessels and nerves. Surgeons believe advantages to this approach may also include earlier and easier recovery, less pain and unrestricted movement after surgery.<br />Brian Hecht, MD received extensive training for the anterior approach and has been performing the hip replacements at Fostoria Community Hospital since September 2018. While Dr. Hecht has been doing traditional hip replacements for many years, he believes in the future of the anterior approach. “The difference is in the recovery,” he says, “because there is no muscle or tendon cutting, which mean less pain and faster restored mobility. This results in less chance for dislocation, shorter time in the hospital, less pain, a better range of movement, and less damage to muscles and soft tissues.”<br />Dr. Hecht refers to the anterior hip approach as a “game changer” as it will restore quality of life in a fraction of the time in comparison to traditional hip replacements.<br />To learn more about hip replacement surgery or to find an orthopaedic surgeon, contact the ProMedica Fostoria Community Hospital surgery department at 419-436-6646.<br /><a href='/location/promedica-fostoria-community-hospital' target='blank'>Learn more about orthopaedic care at Fostoria Community Hospital </a><br /><a href='/services-and-conditions/orthopaedics' target='blank'>Learn more about orthopaedic care at ProMedica </a><br />"

Gaber, president of The University of Toledo. “We are proud to build on our existing Academic Affiliation to continue to advance our region as an innovative leader in education and health care delivery. As part of this new partnership with the College of Nursing, research will be enhanced and the College of Medicine and Life Sciences, through the Academic Affiliation, is committing $1 million to collaborative research between the colleges.”<br />ProMedica is a mission-based, not-for-profit integrated healthcare organization headquartered in Toledo, Ohio.

To be nationally ranked in a specialty, a hospital must excel in caring for the sickest, most medically complex patients. The ratings in procedures and conditions, by contrast, focus on typical Medicare patients. Hospitals that do well in multiple areas of adult care may be ranked in their state and metropolitan area. ProMedica Monroe Regional Hospital achieved the highest rating possible in 1 condition.<br />A hospital's COPD score is based on multiple data categories, including patient survival, volume, discharge to home, staffing and more. Hospitals received one of three ratings -- high performing, average or below average. Hospitals that earned a high performing rating were significantly better than the national average.

With HCR ManorCare being the nation's second largest post-acute and long-term care provider, this partnership has enabled ProMedica to significantly scale its system to become the 15th largest in the nation. The combined organization provides an unmatched breadth of services and capabilities, including: a hospital system, a physician group, telehealth, several health plans, an academic affiliation, skilled nursing, assisted living, rehab, home health and hospice.<br />Randy Oostra, president and CEO of ProMedica, is the CEO of the combined organization. Steve Cavanaugh, former CEO of HCR ManorCare, now serves as the president of the HCR ManorCare division at ProMedica.<br />“This partnership is groundbreaking. Together, we will redefine health care and its role in healthy aging,” said Randy Oostra, president and CEO at ProMedica. “We are focused on tearing down the walls between care delivery channels to provide simpler navigation across the care continuum, along with greater value. Further, we see a tremendous opportunity to engage ProMedica’s nationally-recognized, social determinants of health work to benefit seniors across the communities we serve.”<br />“This relationship is exciting because of all of the opportunities it creates. No other organization in the country offers the breadth of services and capabilities of our combined organizations,” said Steve Cavanaugh, president, HCR ManorCare division at ProMedica. “We are looking forward to leveraging our resources to create a new way of delivering better care and improving outcomes.”<br />While hospitals will always play a significant role in healthcare delivery, the “baby boomers” are aging and their expectations for safe and value-based health care are different than any other prior generation. Forecasts indicate that the 85-and-older population in the United States is expected to double over the next 20 years. This growth will exacerbate the inefficiencies of the current fragmented and costly health systems. This partnership is uniquely positioned to address these challenges by seamlessly coordinating care across multiple health delivery channels to improve quality and reduce the overall cost of care.<br />Toledo, Ohio-based Welltower Inc. (NYSE:WELL), the leading global real estate capital provider to the healthcare industry, played a major role in facilitating this transaction through its innovative approach to using healthcare infrastructure to optimize healthcare delivery to lower cost sites of care while driving improved outcomes.<br />“Together with ProMedica, one of the largest and most innovative health systems in the U.S., this acquisition of HCR ManorCare provides us the platform to think differently about where healthcare services are delivered, particularly with respect to the aging of the population,” said Tom DeRosa, Chief Executive Officer of Welltower. “The close of this transformative joint venture further validates our health system strategy through which we leverage high-quality real estate to optimize care delivery at lower cost sites of care while remaining focused on improved outcomes.”<br />For more information about ProMedica, visit <a href='/'>www.promedica.org</a>.<br /> Download more information. <br />ProMedica is a mission-based, not-for-profit integrated healthcare organization headquartered in Toledo, Ohio.

This is a community initiative to strengthen neighborhoods by addressing the social determinants of health (SDOH) with a key focus on health, education, jobs and family stability. The donation is designed to specifically address education, hunger and nutrition. <br />SDOH, or the conditions in which people live, work and play are an important part of their overall well-being. Up to 80% of an individual’s health can be attributed to lifestyle, environment and socioeconomic factors such as education, job status, income and community safety.<br />“We all have the ability to use our resources to impact others. That’s something Russ Ebeid knew, and continues through the Eidi family.” said Randy Oostra, ProMedica president and CEO. “Ramy and Faye are a shining example of the spirit we all know and want to embrace; to get up every day and say ‘I’m going to make an impact.’ They’re an example to our community, and their ability to make an impact is special.”<br />ProMedica is continuously enhancing its clinical care to include SDOH screening and interventions, as well as to improve SDOH indicators across the communities served. To help accomplish this goal is to help provide the tools, education and resources to improve health and well-being.<br />“My main goal in life can be broken down into two parts: to be a good role model to my children, so they can see I set a precedent of a strong education, work ethic and to always strive for success,” said Ramy Eidi. “Second is to work hard and build on my success so I can continue to give back as much as I can to Toledo and northwest Ohio. This region has given me so much, giving back while I’m alive is the least I can do and the only thing I can take with me at the end.”<br />The ENP will offer a full range of social and educational services to address community needs with a specific focus on children and families. The ENP’s goal is to significantly expand on the scope and purpose of the ProMedica Ebeid Institute to improve health and well-being starting with the UpTown area and later expanding to the Monroe Street Corridor and eventually outlying communities.<br />ProMedica is a member of Toledo, Ohio-based ProMedica, a mission-based, not-for-profit integrated healthcare organization serving communities in Ohio, Michigan, Indiana, Kentucky, Pennsylvania and West Virginia. To date, the organization offers acute and ambulatory care, an insurance company with a dental plan, and post-acute and academic business lines. The 13-hospital system has more than 17,000 employees, 2,700 physicians and advanced practice providers with privileges, and more than 900 healthcare providers employed by ProMedica Physicians. Driven by its Mission to improve your health and well-being, ProMedica has been nationally recognized for its advocacy programs and efforts to address social determinants of health.

This process starts with the completion of the enclosed enrollment packet. This allows us to have access to your student's health history just as any doctor's office would. If you wish to be called before treatment, or wish to be present during an exam, we will be happy to accommodate you, in most cases.<br />The nurse will provide a physical assessment of your student and document the reason for the visit. When medically appropriate, your student will link to a PMCRH Pediatric and Adolescent Clinic physician or nurse practitioner where they can visually see the patient, as well as high-definition camera images of the exam in real time. The school clinic has special assessment equipment that links via Bluetooth to equipment in the Pediatric Clinic so that the provider can see and hear what the nurse sees and hears. We also have a high resolution camera for skin assessments. These images can be saved to the student's file for future reference and/or sent to your primary medical provider if you do not use the PMCRH Pediatric and Adolescent Clinic.<br />If prescriptions are needed, we are able to send them into your pharmacy of choice and will notify you of the need to pick them up, and provide a summary of your student's visit. Your insurance will be billed for the exam just as if your student went to the doctor's office. If your student does not have insurance, we will assist you in enrolling in one that works for you. No one will be denied healthcare due to the inability to pay.<br /> Download our enrollment packet. <br />If you have any questions, please feel free to call 517-279-5295.<br />"

This acquisition provides us the platform to think differently about health and aging.”<br /><br />    <br /><br />    Individuals in their 70s and 80s are the fastest growing segment of the U.S. population, yet the current senior care environment is fragmented, costly and inefficient. Nearly eight million patients are using post-acute care services, presenting a significant opportunity to coordinate those services with healthcare systems to improve quality and reduce the overall cost of care.<br /><br />    <br /><br />    HCR ManorCare, based in Toledo, Ohio, has more than 50,000 employees providing services in 450 assisted living facilities, skilled nursing and rehabilitation centers, memory care communities, outpatient rehabilitation clinics, and hospice and home health agencies operating under the respected names of Heartland, ManorCare Health Services and Arden Courts. Through this transaction, ProMedica, which operates in six states, will expand its footprint into 30 states, employing approximately 70,000 people with projected annual revenues of $7B.<br /><br />    <br /><br />    ProMedica and Welltower (NYSE:WELL), the world's premier health care real estate investment trust (REIT) and leading owner of senior living residences, entered into a strategic joint venture agreement to facilitate the acquisition of HCR ManorCare and Arden Courts real estate assets from Quality Care Properties, Inc. (NYSE:QCP). The resulting partnership will redefine the skilled nursing value paradigm and connect the continuum of care for the patients in the communities we serve.<br /><br />    <br /><br />    “This is an exciting opportunity for Welltower and singularly validates our strategy of partnering with major health systems to drive health care delivery to lower cost settings while improving health outcomes,” commented Welltower CEO Tom DeRosa. “This acquisition will enable ProMedica to expand their service offering beyond acute care hospitals to include home health, post-acute care and residential memory care. ProMedica’s unique wellness focused strategy and investment commitment to the HCR ManorCare assets will make them more consequential sites of care and enhance their value. We are very happy to be the real estate capital behind this transformative transaction.”<br /><br />    <br /><br />    “We are thrilled to have a successful outcome for our shareholders, HCR ManorCare employees and provide continuity and stability for the more than 200,000 of HCR ManorCare patients and residents,” said QCP CEO Mark Ordan. “ProMedica and Welltower together are redefining the settings where health care will be delivered and ProMedica is committed to the investment necessary to enhance the HCR ManorCare platform. QCP is happy to have played a part in facilitating this exciting next chapter for HCR ManorCare.”<br /><br />    <br /><br />    About ProMedica<br /><br />    ProMedica is a mission-based, not-for-profit integrated healthcare organization headquartered in Toledo, Ohio.

This year’s awards focus on the following five areas of public health: behavioral health, communicable diseases, environmental health, injury and violence prevention and ensuring health equity.<br />“I am extremely grateful to work for an organization that is as dedicated to the community, social determinants of health, and innovation as ProMedica is. Receiving this award is truly an honor,” says Nagle. “The high level of cross sector collaboration has allowed our grant team to work together with community agencies to improve the health and wellbeing of those in Lenawee County. I look forward to continuing this work.”<br />“These individuals and organizations have gone above and beyond to improve Michigander’s health and safety,” said Nick Lyon, MDHHS director. “Much of a person’s overall health is determined outside of a doctor’s office, and these award winners have provided opportunities for our state’s citizens to have healthier lives and communities.”<br />Since 2015, Nagle has partnered with local businesses and community leaders in Lenawee County to encourage healthy eating and physical activity. This has resulted in improvements at local corner store markets to encourage consumption of fruits and vegetables; implementation the Lenawee Active Transportation plan to expand and connect hiking/walking trails in the communities; and the creation of a mobile wellness app that challenges users to log steps to promote physical activity in the community. He also worked with our local YMCA to increase community access to a Centers for Disease Control (CDC) recognized Diabetes Prevention Program assisting 331 Lenawee residents with an average weight loss of 6.6 percent, and helped establish a referral process in health systems to identify and support individuals at higher risk for hypertension and diabetes.<br />“This is a well-deserved recognition,” said Julie Yaroch, DO, president of ProMedica Bixby and Herrick Hospitals. “We couldn’t be more proud of Frank’s hard work and contributions to the community.”<br />For more information about ProMedica, visit <a href='/'>http://www.promedica.org</a>.<br />ProMedica Bixby Hospital is a member of Toledo, Ohio-based ProMedica, a mission-based, not-for-profit healthcare organization serving northwest Ohio and southern Michigan.

If you’ve ever needed Urgent Care services before, you know just how important convenient hours are. That’s why, effective April 2, 2018,<a href='/services-and-conditions/urgent-care'> ProMedica Urgent Care</a> changed its hours to 8 a.m. – 8 p.m. The change is effective at all seven locations in the metro Toledo area and was made to better meet the needs of patients.<br />“We were receiving feedback from patients who wished we were open earlier,” explained Shyam Suchak, ProMedica, Urgent Care Director. “Patients with children, in particular, wanted to be able to come first thing in the morning.”<br />Suchak and his team reviewed year-long patient usage data to determine Urgent Care’s most popular times. The data showed that demand was high in the mornings, with usage declining in the evening. Shifting the hours was better for patients and just made sense.<br />“Being convenient for patients is really important to us so people can get the care they need as quickly as possible,” said Suchak.<br />In addition to its hours, ProMedica Urgent Care also aims to offer convenient care through connected medical care. ProMedica patients can access their electronic health record through ProMedica MyChart, and those without a primary care provider are offered the opportunity to be connected with one.<br />“We will actually set up the appointment with an available ProMedica provider before the patient leaves Urgent Care,” explained Suchak. “This continuity ensures that patients not only get the urgent care they need, but also the recommended follow-up care with a primary care provider.”<br /><a href='/services-and-conditions/urgent-care'>Learn more about ProMedica Urgent Care and find a location near you.</a><br />"

Notably, the partnership will leverage funds for a major initiative announced last year called the Ebeid Neighborhood Promise (ENP), which is revitalizing Toledo’s UpTown community, where more than half of residents live in poverty and 30 percent are unemployed. <br />New investments and grants will focus on helping families grow employment skills and boost incomes and education. The goal is to improve community safety, finance healthy homes and vibrant businesses, and ensure communities have quality greenspace and jobs. It is a model that can be replicated in communities across the country.<br />“Health care has traditionally invested heavily in high-tech clinical care and state-of-the-art facilities, yet we underinvest in programs to improve socioeconomic factors. This is despite scientific evidence of how these factors greatly influence a person’s health status,” said Randy Oostra, ProMedica president and CEO. “For several years now, ProMedica has been devoting more resources to address social needs. Now through this partnership with LISC, we will maximize the impact of our efforts, starting in UpTown, and demonstrate the power of partnering with other sectors to accomplish a shared goal.” <br />ProMedica has been screening and studying the impact of social needs on the health of its patients, finding that financial strain, employment, behavioral health, and access to healthy food are among the most critical indicators. As an anchor institution, it also serves as a catalyst for community collaboration and economic development, including ensuring that area neighborhoods thrive.  <br />“Your zip code should not determine your prospects in life,” said Maurice Jones, president and CEO of LISC, a national community development organization that has invested more than $19 billion to spur economic opportunity in struggling areas. “But, right now, your community is the single largest predictor of how well and how long you will live. We have to focus on social, economic and health challenges—all in the same place at the same time—if we want to give families the best chance possible to thrive.”<br />The partnership includes a $20 million pool of grants, half from each organization, that will be deployed over 10 years for community programs and services. It also includes a new $25 million loan fund that will finance development projects that would not otherwise move forward. Of the total lending pool, ProMedica is investing $10 million and LISC is investing $15 million. <br />Importantly, the partners will work with health researchers to develop a new framework for evaluating how these kinds of community investments impact health--integrating data on financial, educational and clinical outcomes to identify what works.<br />“We are taking a data-driven approach that will demonstrate exactly how we’re making a difference,” said Kate Sommerfeld, ProMedica president of social determinants of health. “Our end goal is to develop a national model and best practices that we can replicate across ProMedica’s region and share with other health systems.” <br />The investment effort builds on the partners’ long-time commitment to these issues. <br />ProMedica, which operates in 28 counties in Ohio and Michigan, has emerged as a national leader on social determinants, demonstrating how health institutions can leverage their expertise and resources to advance key goals.<br />For 40 years, LISC has been investing in thousands of urban and rural communities across the country, including $150 million in Toledo since 1989. In late 2017, LISC announced it would deploy an anticipated $10 billion in national investments over the next decade in ways that are specifically designed to upend health disparities, as well as raise overall standards of living. The partnership with ProMedica is the first national collaboration designed to support LISC’s expanded health focus.<br />“Health care institutions can wield remarkable influence over social determinants, not just by the care they provide but by the data they have on place-based health challenges,” Jones said. “When we connect their talent and their resources to the expertise of community developers, we have an opportunity to drive changes that help people live better—literally adding years to their life. That’s incredibly powerful.”<br />To move forward, LISC and ProMedica will begin working with community partners and stakeholders in UpTown this month to engage residents. An operations team based at UpTown’s ProMedica Ebeid Institute will focus on expanding job-training opportunities for residents and onboarding additional community health workers, financial coaches and jobs coaches who will provide free services to the community.<br />For more information about the ProMedica and LISC partnership, visit <a href='http://www.promedica.org/ebeidpromise'>www.promedica.org/ebeidpromise</a>.<br />ProMedica is a mission-based, not-for-profit healthcare organization serving northwest Ohio and southern Michigan.

Today, the two organizations will announce the details of the new partnership to re-open the WPA-era building in the spring of 2019 as a natural history museum. The new facility will have a focus on biodiversity, or the variety of life in the world, throughout the course of history shown through the lens of local habitats and wildlife along with their ties to global counterparts.<br />Through their $3.5 million donation, ProMedica is generously supporting a fully collaborative effort to combine the messaging in the new Museum with the missions of both institutions. Through tangible interactives and a proposed doctors as docents program, ProMedica will assist in educating Museum visitors about the connections between human quality of life and wellbeing with natural biodiversity.<br />The new facility will have a focus on biodiversity, or the variety of life in the world, throughout the course of history shown through the lens of local habitats and wildlife along with their ties to global counterparts.<br />“ProMedica is proud to partner with the Toledo Zoo and sponsor this amazing Museum where people will learn about the connection between our environment, living organisms and modern medicine,” said Randy Oostra, CEO/President of ProMedica. “As an anchor institution, ProMedica’s role is to support institutions like the Toledo Zoo – one of our city’s crown jewels -- as part of our continued commitment to helping build on the progress and momentum taking place in Toledo from downtown into the surrounding neighborhoods.”<br />Construction on the Museum of Science began in 1934, putting many local craftsmen to work during the Great Depression and utilizing re-purposed local materials, including slate slabs from the Maumee River. Throughout the renovation process, which began in fall of 2017, the footprint and most of the framework of the historic building was kept intact. With the addition of the greenhouse on the front, the new facility will total 66,000 square feet.<br />Not to give too much away, but visitors can expect to experience Ohio 13,000 years ago, touch live animals, walk through a two-story sensory-rich tropical greenhouse, and truly feel like a fly on the wall in a 30x larger than life oak forest! And that is only the beginning of the immersive and interactive adventure that awaits in the new haven of habitats and bounty of biology! <br />ProMedica healthcare experts and Toledo Zoo science experts will work together to educate museum visitors about the fascinating connections between wildlife and biology.<br />ProMedica healthcare experts and Toledo Zoo science experts will work together to educate museum visitors about the fascinating connections between wildlife and biology. There are many intersections of the natural world and the field of medicine, including native prairies that help human health,support our fruit and vegetable crops and filter toxins out of our water supply. The 'Gila monster' exhibit will demonstrate how the use of a natural hormone in the saliva of lizards is used to help control glucose levels and weight loss in people with diabetes.<br />“We are honored to have a partner that understands human health and well-being is supported by a healthy natural environment. Since the very beginning, ProMedica has shared our vision of creating a new educational yet entertaining opportunity for the local community to enjoy. This Museum serves as a tangible link to how our animals and conservation efforts are interconnected throughout the world and spans of time and we can’t wait to share it with our guests,” said Jeff Sailer, CEO/President of Toledo Zoo.<br />The new partnership of Toledo Zoo and ProMedica encourages the public to stay tuned for updates on the status of the renovations.

The Micra® Transcatheter Pacing System (TPS) is a new type of heart device, approved for Medicare reimbursement, that provides patients with the most advanced pacing technology at one-tenth the size of a traditional pacemaker. The first procedure was performed by electrophysiologist, Kamala Tamirisa, MD, FACC, FHRS.<br />Bradycardia is a condition characterized by a slow or irregular heart rhythm, usually fewer than 60 beats per minute. At this rate, the heart is unable to pump enough oxygen-rich blood for the body during normal activity or exercise, causing dizziness, fatigue, shortness of breath or fainting spells. Pacemakers are the most common way to treat bradycardia to help restore the heart’s normal rhythm and relieve symptoms by sending electrical impulses to the heart to increase the heart rate.<br />Unlike traditional pacemakers, Micra® is comparable in size to a large vitamin and does not require cardiac wires (leads) or a surgical “pocket” under the skin to deliver a pacing therapy. Instead, the device is small enough to be delivered through a catheter and implanted directly into the heart with small tines, providing a safe alternative to conventional pacemakers without the complications associated with leads.<br />The Micra TPS was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in April 2016, and has been granted Medicare reimbursement, allowing broad patient access to the novel pacing technology.<br />To learn more about heart services offered at ProMedica Heart Institute, visit promedica.org/heart.<br />ProMedica Toledo Hospital is a member of Toledo, Ohio-based ProMedica, a mission-based, not-for-profit healthcare organization serving northwest Ohio and southeast Michigan.

The member substitution transaction officially closed on Jan. 1, 2018. The joinder agreement includes a Branch County-area board of trustees with redefined governance authority. <br />“We are pleased to welcome the Community Health Center of Branch County to ProMedica,” said Randy Oostra, president and CEO, ProMedica. “From the beginning, it was clear that our organizations share similar values and a strong commitment to strengthening our communities. We look forward to working together to further enhance the quality of healthcare services and build on the hospital’s long-standing commitment to the residents of Branch County.”<br />“This has been an exciting journey for us,” stated Randy DeGroot, president and CEO, ProMedica Coldwater Regional Hospital. “Joining ProMedica enhances our ability to provide the very best care for our communities. By collaborating and expanding our clinical expertise, as well as broadening access to needed services, residents of Branch County and the surroundings communities will experience more effective and efficient care.”<br />ProMedica Coldwater Regional Hospital, a not-for-profit organization, serves south central Michigan. The hospital and its physician practices offer a wide range of diagnostic, medical and surgical services in areas such as behavioral health, emergency medicine, general surgery, internal medicine, obstetrics/gynecology, oncology, ophthalmology, orthopaedics, primary care, podiatry, pulmonary, urology, wound healing, and women’s and children’s services. <br />The 87-bed hospital has more than 600 employees and 190 physicians and advanced practice providers on the hospital’s medical staff. In 2016, Coldwater Regional Hospital provided care for its community through more than 142,000 outpatient visits, 56,200 clinic visits, 24,600 emergency visits, and 2,800 admissions. <br />The hospital receives regular recognition for its quality including its safety initiatives and obstetrics care. Most notably, the Michigan Hospital Association recently awarded Coldwater Regional Hospital with the Ludwig Community Benefit Award for the hospital’s school tele-medicine program. The program increases access to primary care for the community’s youth by using tele-medicine to connect the hospital’s pediatric and adolescent center with local high school health clinics that are staffed by hospital nurses. <br />DeGroot added, “To ensure a seamless transition for our patients, employees and physicians, our integration team will continue its diligent and collaborative work. In addition, over the next several months, strategies will be developed to expand services in our community. The goal will be to attract a broader offering of medical specialties to Branch County and surrounding communities.”<br />Next week, on Monday, Jan. 8, 2018, Oostra will visit Coldwater to hold a series of employee forums as well as to meet with hospital leaders, physicians and community members. At noon, a public ribbon-cutting ceremony will be held in the main lobby of the hospital, located at 274 E.

The valve, designed for the treatment of aortic valve disease, was implanted during an open-heart surgery by ProMedica Cardiothoracic Surgeon <a href='https://www.promedica.org/provider/michael-g-moront-md-facs-cardiothoracic-surgery'>Michael Moront MD, FACS</a>.<br />Heart valve disease affects about five million Americans each year. Aortic valve disease occurs when the valve between the main pumping chamber of the heart and the main artery to the body (aorta) fails to work properly.<br />The Avalus valve was developed in close collaboration with expert surgeons to enhance clinical performance and address the contemporary needs of cardiac surgeons, as well as patients who are candidates for aortic valve replacement. In addition to being the first stented surgical aortic valve that is MRI-safe (without restrictions), the Avalus valve is uniquely designed for easier implantation, an important factor during more complex surgeries. Further, the Avalus valve will allow patients to receive future minimally-invasive valve-in-valve interventions if necessary and appropriate.<br />“We are excited to have been part of the initial trial for the Avalus valve that led to FDA approval, and we’re honored to have been chosen to perform the first commercial implant in the country,” said Michael Moront, MD, ProMedica cardiothoracic surgeon. “It’s exciting to play a key role in helping to bring new innovations to the field of medicine. At ProMedica, we remain committed to thoroughly exploring and adopting the most advanced cardiac surgical solutions to help improve long-term patient outcomes,” Dr. Moront added.       <br />“Medtronic would like to congratulate the team at ProMedica in Toledo, Ohio, for performing the first commercial Avalus valve implant in the U.S.,” said Rhonda Robb, vice president and general manager of the Heart Valve Therapies business, a part of Medtronic’s Cardiac and Vascular Group. “By continuing to collaborate with leading cardiac surgeons around the world, we look forward to bringing heart valve replacement solutions like the Avalus valve to assist in expanding access and improving outcomes for clinical and patient communities.”<br />Learn more in the video below (Warning: includes graphic surgery footage).<br /><iframe src='https://www.facebook.com/plugins/video.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2FProMedicaToledoHospital%2Fvideos%2F1776603022370407%2F&amp;show_text=0&amp;width=560'></iframe><br />ProMedica Toledo Hospital is a member of Toledo, Ohio-based ProMedica, a mission-based, not-for-profit healthcare organization serving northwest Ohio and southeast Michigan.

In addition, ProMedica Toledo Hospital was the first hospital in Toledo and one of the first in the country to become certified as a Comprehensive Stroke Center, the highest level of stroke certification offered by The Joint Commission and American Heart Association/American Stroke Association. <br />“BrightMatter will allow us to continue to provide best-in-class cancer and stroke treatment at ProMedica Toledo Hospital. And, its technological advancement will help make safe surgery possible for patients previously thought to be inoperable,” said Kevin Reinard, MD, neurosurgeon, ProMedica Physicians Neurosurgery. <br />BrightMatter provides neurosurgeons with the latest advancements in visualization tools to perform minimally invasive, patient-specific procedures. Using an imaging method called diffusion tensor imaging, or DTI, BrightMatter automatically processes whole brain tractography to customize a surgical approach to the patient’s specific tumor. This functionality allows surgeons to see details that can’t be seen with the naked eye and may allow access to brain locations previously deemed inoperable.<br />The surgical plan is integrated into BrightMatter’s navigation system and allows the surgeon to see a patient’s fiber tracts in real time. They also use Synaptive’s fully automated digital microscope, a high-powered magnification system mounted on a robotic arm that automatically follows the surgeon’s tools. This replaces the need to manipulate cumbersome optics with a view of the entire operative field with unprecedented detail. BrightMatter allows for better surgical ergonomics, facilitates collaboration with operating room staff, and consumes less surgical time, all factors that could lead to better outcomes.<br />“ProMedica Toledo Hospital was recently recognized as one of America’s 100 Best Hospitals by Healthgrades for being in the top two percent of hospitals in the U.S. for clinical excellence. We are excited to work with them and Dr. Reinard to ensure their patients get the best medical treatment in the region using the most advanced surgical technology,” said Cameron Piron, co-founder and president, Synaptive.<br />About ProMedica Toledo Hospital| ProMedica Toledo Hospital is a member of Toledo, Ohio-based ProMedica, a mission-based, not-for-profit healthcare organization serving northwest Ohio and southeast Michigan.

    "content": "<br />New technology makes breast surgery more comfortable Press Release<br />New technology makes breast surgery more comfortable<br />Breast cancer patients in northwest Ohio and southeast Michigan now have a new option for marking tumors before breast surgery. Magseed, offered at the <a href='/location/promedica-breast-care'>ProMedica Breast Care </a>provides a simpler, more effective alternative to the traditional wire localization methods that have been used for more than 30 years.<br />Breast cancer screening mammography and better therapies have decreased the mortality from the disease by over 30%. Nonetheless, breast cancer is the second most common cause of cancer deaths among women.<br />Until now, most women having surgery to remove a breast tumor (lumpectomy)  had to undergo a 'wire localization' procedure where a wire is inserted into the tumor and served as a road map for the breast surgeon to remove the diseased tissue.<br />    Although widely used, wire localizations have known complications for women:<br />    The guide wire must be inserted the same day prior to surgery which causes discomfort and worsens pre surgical anxiety. The wire may be in place for hours if surgery is unexpectedly delayed. Occasionally,  difficulty in wire placement may result in long delays for surgery start times. <br />    Because the guide wire protrudes from the skin,  there is an increased risk for infection. <br />    Wires can also move or be dislodged<br />Magseed directly addresses these complications. First, it is smaller than a grain of rice and can be placed into a tumor up to 30 days before the patient’s surgery. Deployment of the Magseed is quick and easy.  Once the seed is implanted, it produces no discomfort rarely moves and stays within the breast. During surgery, a magnetic probe called a Sentimag detects the Magseed, guiding the surgeon to the tumor. The Sentimag probe and Magseed provideds more accurate removal of cancerous tissue, ensuring that more healthy tissue can be left behind (better cosmetic result).<br />U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved Magseed in 2016. In January 2017, The University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) became the first US site to adopt Magseed as its standard of care. Shortly after in August, ProMedica Toledo Hospital adopted Magseed as its standard of care becoming the first hospital in the area to use the new technology – thanks in part thanks to The Toledo Hospital Foundation, who purchased the probe for <a href='/location/promedica-breast-care'>ProMedica Breast Care</a>.<br />ProMedica is a mission-based, not-for-profit healthcare organization serving northwest Ohio and southeast Michigan.

The $60 million investment has sparked further economic development in downtown Toledo with additional businesses relocating to the area and new restaurants opening up.<br />“As an anchor institution, we have a responsibility to reinvest in our communities and we’re happy to play a role in the revitalization of downtown Toledo,” said Randy Oostra, president and CEO of ProMedica. “Additionally, the new ProMedica Headquarters has transformed our workplace culture. Our administrative employees – the employees that support our caregivers – are more efficient and the open office environment has been great for team building.”<br />ProMedica Headquarters features modern design while honoring the history of Toledo and the former steam plant. Key elements include:<br /><br />•    A history wall is located along a corridor of The Steam Plant provides a visual timeline of downtown Toledo’s history covering important events in the area from 1650 to the present.<br /><br />•    A 13-ton bridge crane on the original crane rail is suspended above The Steam Plant’s four-story atrium. In 19th century Toledo, the crane moved turbines and boilers along the length of The Steam Plant.<br /><br />•    Exposed brick walls were maintained throughout The Steam Plant. Reclaimed brick from the east wall was used throughout the campus.<br />“We made sure to respect the history of the site and bring back to life something the community can enjoy,” said Robin Whitney, senior vice president of real estate and construction, ProMedica.<br /><iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/_F7YGqJeVdo?enablejsapi=1'></iframe><br />For more information about ProMedica, visit <a href='/'>www.promedica.org</a>.<br />ProMedica is a mission-based, not-for-profit healthcare organization serving northwest Ohio and southeast Michigan.

The centers feature additional convenience with upfront pricing.<br />“We are setting a new standard for medical care with a primary focus on providing appropriate care in the right setting that is more expedient and affordable. We also want to prevent unnecessary visits to the emergency room,” said Lee Hammerling, MD, chief medical officer, ProMedica. “Urgent care is one of the fastest growing specialties in the medical field due to the extended hours and immediate availability. It is a trend that we expect to see increase locally and nationally.” <br />Over the past 20 years, there has been a major boom in the urgent care industry driven by demand for immediate access to medical care. According to the American Academy of Urgent Care Medicine, the number of urgent care facilities in the United States increased from 8,000 to 9,300 since 2008.

It affects more than 2.7 million Americans, according to the American Heart Association.<br />With every heartbeat, your heart contracts and relaxes to a regular beat – pumping blood from the upper chambers of your heart to the lower chambers and out to the rest of your body.<br />“If you experience AFib, the electrical signal that starts your heartbeat is jumbled. It causes the upper chamber of your heart to contract and relax too fast and irregularly. Then, your upper chamber becomes out of sync with your lower chamber, causing blood to pool in your upper chamber” says Timothy Phelan, MD, electrophysiologist with ProMedica Physicians Cardiology.<br />The danger? Dr. Phelan explains, “Pooling blood can form a blood clot that may escape your heart and lodge in an artery leading to your brain. This causes a stroke.” In fact, people with AFib are five times more likely to have a stroke than those without AFib.<br />AFib can present with a number of different feelings in your chest. “These symptoms may occur once in a while or all of the time and can range from mild to severe discomfort” says Dr. Phelan. And, although these are common symptoms, some people do not experience symptoms. This is true for about 30% of people with AFib.<br />If you are experiencing symptoms of AFib schedule an immediate appointment with a cardiologist.

The event will be free and open to the community. <br />The inaugural ProMedica Summer Concert Series will kick off at 7:30 p.m. on Friday, July 21, with a concert featuring Crystal Bowersox and Calysta Bevier. Bowersox, an Ottawa County native, burst onto the national entertainment scene in 2010. The singer-songwriter now lives in Nashville and in June released a new album called “Alive.” Musicians from the TSO will join Bowersox on stage for her portion of the concert. <br />Bevier of Grand Rapids, Ohio, is a singer-songwriter who survived a rare form of cancer. She was a semi-finalist last fall on America’s Got Talent, which propelled her to a budding music career. She continues to be an inspirational speaker to cancer patients.<br />The second concert will be 7:30 p.m. on Friday, Aug. 25, and features Grammy Award-winning producer and vocalist Steve Tyrell. The third concert, A Symphonic Tribute to the Music of Prince, will be 7:30 p.m. Friday, Sept. 15. A tribute band made up of former members of Prince’s New Power Generation will perform his biggest hits, including “Purple Rain,” “When Doves Cry,” “U Got the Look,” “Raspberry Beret,” and more.<br />The concerts will be reminiscent of the Rally by the River events at Promenade Park in the 1980s and early 1990s, but larger in scope of entertainment. The stage will be near the Maumee River; the performers also will be seen on a video wall on the side of the new parking garage. Each event will feature food trucks and an area serving beer and wine. <br /><br />For more information about these events, visit <a href='http://www.promedica.org/summerconcerts'>www.promedica.org/summerconcerts</a>. <br />ProMedica is a mission-based, not-for-profit healthcare organization serving northwest Ohio and southeast Michigan.

Since June 15, 2016, more than 400 cancer patients have received treatment close to home in Oregon.<br />On June 7, 2017, current and former patients gathered for the very first <a href='/services-and-conditions/cancer/'>ProMedica Cancer Institute</a> survivor celebration at Bay Park Hospital. A “Sweet Survivorship” ice cream social was held and a special gift was given to each survivor.<br />Deb Ersnthausen, the first patient treated at Bay Park Hospital, was among those attending the event. Deb credits the cancer team in Oregon for helping to make her experience more comfortable. She said, “The setting and the staff make it so that you’re not thinking about what you’re having done to you. They’re great people to have around you. After coming for treatments and blood work, they become like family.”<br />Patients are cared for by a team of specially trained professionals. Mohammad Mobayed, MD, ProMedica Physicians Hematology/Oncology Associates (HOA), sees patients in the hospital-based medical oncology clinic. The clinic is equipped with three private exam rooms and six private infusion bays including a treatment bed. These treatment areas comfortably accommodate patients and family/loved ones who want to remain with the patient during treatment.<br />'We are so privileged to have a team of physicians, nurses and support staff who are all dedicated to providing excellent, individualized care for each patient. Making our patients feel comfortable and secure in the care they are receiving is our main focus,' says Tracy Przybylski, director, ProMedica Bay Park Hospital’s cancer and infusion services. “We consider everyone we treat as a survivor, from diagnosis, through treatment and beyond.”<br />Complementary services are also offered to patients, including cancer rehab, healing care, survivorship care planning, nutritional services and pharmacy counseling.<br /><a href='/location/promedica-bay-park-hospital-cancer-center'>Learn more about ProMedica Bay Park Hospital’s cancer and infusion services.</a><br />"

The center is the sixth ProMedica Urgent Care site across the area and provides easier access to convenient, high-quality care at the lowest cost possible.  <br /><a href='/services-and-conditions/urgent-care'>ProMedica Urgent Care</a> is expanding options for treating minor emergencies and immediate medical needs. It offers a broad range of services, including X-rays, lab testing and simple sutures, for a low urgent care copay compared to the more expensive emergency center cost for the same service. In addition, ProMedica Urgent Care offers the consumer the options to walk-in or preregister their visit by calling ahead, This allows the urgent care to better manage your wait time. The centers feature additional convenience with upfront pricing.<br />“We are setting a new standard for medical care with a primary focus on providing appropriate care in the right setting that is more expedient and affordable. We also want to prevent unnecessary visits to the emergency room,” said Lee Hammerling, MD, chief medical officer, ProMedica. “Urgent care is one of the fastest growing specialties in the medical field due to the extended hours and immediate availability. It is a trend that we expect to see increase locally and nationally.” <br />Over the past 20 years, there has been a major boom in the urgent care industry driven by demand for immediate access to medical care. According to the American Academy of Urgent Care Medicine, the number of urgent care facilities in the United States increased from 8,000 to 9,300 since 2008. Approximately 50 – 100 new sites open each year.<br />To meet this growing need, ProMedica Urgent Care offices are open during the day as well as evenings, weekends and holidays. Certified nurse practitioners (CNPs) treat adults, children and infants as young as six months. CNPs are registered nurses with advanced medical training and education to treat a broad range of primary care needs. <br />“We have a highly-trained and experienced medical team ready to handle a wide variety of minor injuries, infections and other urgent medical needs,” said Cindy Edwards-Tuttle, family nurse practitioner – board certified, ProMedica. “Telemedicine technology will allow for face-to-face consultations with hospital emergency room doctors and other specialists to expedite care as needed. We are connected with your primary care providers and provide clinical summaries of the visit so that your doctor is aware of your urgent care needs and how we managed your care during the visit.” <br />ProMedica has the region’s largest network of primary and specialty care services with nearly 1,000 physicians and advanced medical providers in northwest Ohio and southeast Michigan. Our nurse practitioners are able to make referrals to our specialists to expedite access for follow-up care and to assure the highest quality of care is provided.<br />“Our urgent care and after hours clinics are designed to ensure that our patients always have a lower cost of care option for medical care and are well-connected to ProMedica’s hospitals and medical facilities,” said Edwards-Tuttle. “Whether it is a routine medical need or a minor emergency, we’ve got you covered.”<br />For more information about ProMedica Urgent Care, visit <a href='/services-and-conditions/urgent-care'>www.promedica.org/urgentcare</a>.<br />ProMedica is a mission-based, not-for-profit healthcare organization serving northwest Ohio and southeast Michigan.

    "content": "<br />KeyBank and ProMedica Commit $2.65 Million to Revitalize Central Toledo-Area Neighborhoods  Press Release<br />KeyBank and ProMedica Commit $2.65 Million to Revitalize Central Toledo-Area Neighborhoods <br />TOLEDO, Ohio, April 12, 2017 – KeyBank and ProMedica today announced the joint commitment of $2.65 million to drive economic development in central Toledo-area neighborhoods through revitalized local housing and the reduction of blight. Working with the Local Initiative Support Corporation (LISC), the corporations will work to upgrade affordable rental properties while at the same time making it easier for first-time homebuyers to establish roots in communities adjacent to downtown Toledo. <br />“Key has long invested in the growth of the central Toledo community and today’s major gift from the Key Foundation not only continues that tradition, but elevates it to another level,” said Jim Hoffman, KeyBank market president. “We know that a critical part of any community is stable affordable housing. Individuals earning below the area median income benefit from programs and services that help lower their monthly rent and provide secure, stable housing. With this groundbreaking investment, we are furthering our commitment to helping central Toledo families reach their full potential, driving economic development, and helping neighborhoods thrive.”<br />The new collaboration reinforces the efforts of the city’s YR 16 task force—focused on preserving 700 units of rental housing that have aged out of federal financing programs and attracting a diversified economic base of nearby homeowners. That not only makes Toledo communities stronger, but also recognizes the clear connection between better housing and better health, and the long-term implications for all of Toledo’s residents, according to Randy Oostra, ProMedica president and CEO.<br />“There is a growing focus in the healthcare industry on the connection between substandard housing and an increased risk of chronic health conditions. We’re seeing more research that points to it being a major public health issue,” Oostra explained. “For years, ProMedica has been purposefully focused on social issues that impact health and well-being and we are pleased to be working with KeyBank, the City of Toledo, LISC and other area organizations to collectively improve area health outcomes.<br />The new effort also recognizes a growing economic imperative in Toledo where 25 percent of renters spend more than half of their income on housing. This leaves less of their earnings for basic necessities such as food, clothing, healthcare and transportation. Accordingly, this creates a ripple effect on nearby businesses and schools, affecting everything from crime to property values.<br />Kim Cutcher, executive director of LISC’s Toledo program, also pointed to the impact of leverage from this investment. “When we strengthen the economic base of local residents, we can attract other investment to these neighborhoods. Entrepreneurs are more likely to open businesses. People can shop in their own community. It helps rev up the local economy and people live better, longer and healthier.”<br />Cutcher pointed to the importance of the YR 16 task force in advancing that strategy. In addition to LISC, the task force includes the City of Toledo Department of Neighborhoods, NeighborWorks Toledo Region, Ohio Housing Finance Agency, the Lucas County Land Bank, the National Equity Fund and the Ohio Capital Corporation for Housing. The project will leverage an additional $5 Million from the City of Toledo, LISC, the Lucas County Land Bank and NeighborWorks Toledo Region. <br />Through this collaboration, 200 area residents will become homeowners over a three-year period. ProMedica, KeyBank, LISC and NeighborWorks will provide funding for this initiative that will go toward home loans and assisting residents with making upgrades to their homes.<br /><br />ProMedica is a mission-based, not-for-profit healthcare organization serving northwest Ohio and southeast Michigan. The 12-hospital system has more than 15,000 employees, nearly 2,100 physicians and advanced practice providers with privileges, and more than 800 healthcare providers employed by ProMedica Physicians. Additionally it offers a health plan, Paramount, which serves 331,000 members including more than 230,000 members in the statewide Medicaid plan. Driven by its Mission to improve your health and well-being, ProMedica offers a full range of diagnostic, medical and surgical specialties in areas such as emergency medicine and trauma, behavioral health, heart and vascular, oncology, orthopaedics, neurology, and women’s and children’s services. The health system has been nationally recognized for its advocacy programs and efforts to raise awareness about hunger as a health issue.

Offering these services will help develop a diverse pool of entrepreneurial talent, attract venture capital firms and other investors, and help support and enable company operations.<br /><br /><br /><br />“The vision for NextTech is to create an ecosystem which consistently generates high-tech, high-wage jobs and opportunity in northwest Ohio,” said <a href='https://www.promedica.org/provider/john-pigott-md-facs-vascular-surgery'>John Pigott, M.D., FACS</a>, ProMedica Chief Innovation Officer/Strategic Business Development, and lead for developing the RFP response to the Ohio Third Frontier. “The mission is to drive a technology-based start-up environment through a broad and inclusive entrepreneurial community in northwest Ohio by providing intensive business commercialization services to prepare companies for funding and sustainability. “<br /><br /><br /><br />As part of the collaborative effort between the partnering organizations, a governance structure has been developed to ensure that conflicts of interests will be eliminated.  <br /><br /><br /><br />Key agencies in the region, including the Toledo-Lucas Country Port Authority, Regional Growth Partnership, Toledo Regional Chamber of Commerce and the Downtown Toledo Development Corporation (22nd Century Committee recently transition to DTDC), are supportive of NextTech and feel it is critical for northwest Ohio to have an ESP.<br /><br /><br /><br />“This is a tremendous opportunity that we are very thankful to have,” said Oostra. “The ESP will help to continue to build on the revitalization and economic development momentum we have already established.
