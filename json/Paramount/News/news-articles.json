      "body": "<br />Paramount Dental Launches Tele-Dental Services For Members<br />TOLEDO, Ohio, January 16, 2023 – Paramount Dental is pleased to announce the launch of tele-dental services for members. The new service will allow members to access a dentist online from the comfort of their own homes at no additional cost. In partnership with The TeleDentists, Paramount Dental now enables patients to utilize virtual tools to access on-demand dentists and other resources.<br />A network of dentists are on-call and available for virtual dental visits 24/7/365 via mobile app, phone or web. Through a video consultation, the licensed dentists in the network can diagnose oral or dental problems, creating a personalized treatment plan. Upon diagnosis, the dentist can start the patient on remediation, which may include medication. When follow-up care is needed, appointments are booked with an appropriate dentist located near the member.<br />The TeleDentists is a national virtual care dental provider with more than 300 dentists in its network. All consulting dentists are board licensed and carefully screened.<br />'As the need for telemedicine continues to grow, this offering ensures Paramount Dental members have convenient access to an in-network provider close to home or virtually,' said Josh Nace, president of Paramount Dental. 'With the ability to provide a dental visit virtually, we hope that members will utilize dental benefits and can seek care in a timely manner, improving dental health and overall health.'<br />'We are thrilled to help Paramount Dental expand its services to members in Ohio, Michigan, Indiana and Kentucky,' says Dr. Maria Kunstadter, co-founder and CEO of The TeleDentists. 'Increasing access to oral health services is imperative to saving healthcare costs for members.'<br />Media contact: Mary Modene<br /> Office: <a href='tel:15675850326'>567-585-0326</a><br /> Email: <a href='mailto:media.relations@promedica.org'>media.relations@promedica.org</a><br /> Cell: <a href='tel:14192620371'>419-262-0371</a><br /> Website: <a href='https://www.insuringsmiles.com'>insuringsmiles.com</a><br />"

      "body": "<br />We are thrilled to share that for 2023 Paramount’s Medicare Advantage plans, called Paramount Elite (HMO), received 4.5 out 5 stars from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS). CMS publishes Star Ratings for Medicare Advantage (Medicare Part C) and Medicare Part D plans each year.<br />“Achieving 4.5 out of 5 stars for 2023 is especially rewarding in this challenging post-pandemic environment. While our star rating increased from 4 to 4.5 out of 5 stars, the average star rating for Medicare Advantage plans decreased from 4.37 stars to 4.15 out of 5 stars,” explained Holly Zorz, team lead for Medicare quality improvement, Paramount.<br />What are Medicare Star Ratings?<br />The rating system helps Medicare consumers compare the quality of health plans and rounds out benefit and cost information to support shopping decisions.<br />Every health plan is rated against the same criteria to give consumers a fair quality and performance comparison of the plans in their area. Medicare evaluates a plan’s staying healthy programs, care coordination, access to care and medication, managing chronic conditions, member experience and satisfaction, pharmacy services, and customer service.<br />CMS uses a five-star quality rating system to evaluate the quality and performance of Medicare Advantage health plans. One star is the lowest rating; five stars is the highest.<br />To learn more about a Medicare Advantage plan from Paramount Elite, call us at <a href='tel:8888910707'>888-891-0707</a> (TTY <a href='tel:18888910707'>888-740-5670</a>).

Then it provides a few easy-to-follow next steps.<br />Questions to ask yourself:<br />Are you happy with your doctors?<br />Are you happy with the amount you’re paying in premiums?<br />How about the amount you’re paying in copays?<br />Are you comfortable with your prescription coverage?<br />Do you like the facilities, hospitals and pharmacies that are covered under your plan?<br />Do you feel your deductible is a good fit for your budget?<br />Do you think the coverage outside your area suits your travel needs?<br />Does your plan have enhanced benefits you value, like the SilverSneakers® Fitness program?<br />If you answered no to more than one or two of these, it’s definitely worth looking into a new plan. It doesn’t mean you have to change, but you may find one you like better. Or you may realize the one you have isn’t so bad.<br />If you do want to change, there is always the Annual Enrollment Period which runs from Oct. 15 to Dec 7 every year.
