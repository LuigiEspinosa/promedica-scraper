CMS publishes Star Ratings for Medicare Advantage (Medicare Part C) and Medicare Part D plans each year.</p>\n<p>“Achieving 4.5 out of 5 stars for 2023 is especially rewarding in this challenging post-pandemic environment. While our star rating increased from 4 to 4.5 out of 5 stars, the average star rating for Medicare Advantage plans decreased from 4.37 stars to 4.15 out of 5 stars,” explained Holly Zorz, team lead for Medicare quality improvement, Paramount.</p>\n<h2>What are Medicare Star Ratings?</h2>\n<p>The rating system helps Medicare consumers compare the quality of health plans and rounds out benefit and cost information to support shopping decisions.</p>\n<p>Every health plan is rated against the same criteria to give consumers a fair quality and performance comparison of the plans in their area. Medicare evaluates a plan’s staying healthy programs, care coordination, access to care and medication, managing chronic conditions, member experience and satisfaction, pharmacy services, and customer service.</p>\n<p>CMS uses a five-star quality rating system to evaluate the quality and performance of Medicare Advantage health plans. One star is the lowest rating; five stars is the highest.</p>\n<p>To learn more about a Medicare Advantage plan from Paramount Elite, call us at <a href=\"tel:8888910707\">888-891-0707</a> (TTY <a href=\"tel:18888910707\">888-740-5670</a>).

Their families also can have extra income for the holidays: younger children in <a href=\"https://medicaid.oahp.org/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Ohio Medicaid Managed Care plans\">Ohio Medicaid Managed Care</a> plans are eligible for a $100 gift card when they receive the first shot, just as their older family members have been.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This comes as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) gives the green light for 28 million kids in the 5 to 11 age group to get the vaccine. According to the Ohio Department of Health, 206,000 COVID-19 cases have occurred in Ohio children 17 and younger and 2,000 of those have required hospitalization.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The timing of this vaccine for preadolescent children is critical as Ohio heads into the winter months and indoor gatherings rise — two factors that have historically increased the number of COVID-19 cases,” said Kelly O’Reilly, president and CEO of the <a href=\"https://oahp.org/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Ohio Association of Health Plans\">Ohio Association of Health Plans</a>. “According to the medical directors of our health plans, greatly increasing the number of vaccinated people is the key to ending the pandemic.</p>\n<p><dpiv>Working together, Ohio’s Medicaid Managed Care plans — Aetna, Buckeye Health Plan, CareSource, Molina Healthcare, <a href=\"/medicaid/\" title=\"Paramount Advantage\">Paramount Advantage</a> and UnitedHealthcare — made finding and getting the vaccine easier than ever with <a href=\"https://www.covidvaxonthespot.com/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Vax on the Spot\">Vax on the Spot</a>, a website with information on community vaccine events, transportation solutions and walk-in opportunities at pharmacies.&nbsp;&nbsp;</dpiv></p>\n<p>Understanding that parents and caregivers have concerns about the safety of the vaccines and possible side effects and long-term effects, the health plans have included on the Vax on the Spot site a <a href=\"https://www.covidvaxonthespot.com/get-the-facts/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Q&amp;A page \">Q&amp;A page </a>outlining key facts: The vaccines are safe for children and for pregnant women, and the risks of contracting COVID-19 are greater than any risk associated with receiving the vaccine.&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Provider Reimbursement&nbsp;</h3>\n<p>As part of this initiative, the health plans also have expanded a $100 vaccination reimbursement payment for providers and pharmacists. Rather than solely on the first dose, the reimbursement payments now apply when each dose, including boosters, is given of the Pfizer-BioNTech, Johnson &amp; Johnson’s Janssen and Moderna COVID-19 vaccinations.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The expanded payments for providers are another tool for overcoming hesitancy, as they make it feasible for pharmacists and other providers to take the time to counsel patients and caregivers about their concerns.&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Campaign is Working&nbsp;</h3>\n<p>In a new <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9n5R-69h6E\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"video \">video </a>highlighting the Vax on the Spot campaign, health plans, providers and community partners explain how they worked collaboratively to educate and vaccinate vulnerable Ohioans.

However, it’s important to take extra precautions to protect yourself and your loved ones. One way we can do this is by wearing a mask while in public.</p>\n<p><span class=\"h2\">Follow the steps below before putting on or taking off your mask. Donning (Putting on):</span></p>\n<ol>\n<li>To get started, complete hand hygiene. That means wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds or use hand sanitizer before touching the mask.</li>\n<li>Check to make sure that there are no obvious tears or holes on either side of the mask.</li>\n<li>Follow the instructions below for the type of mask you are using.</li>\n<ul>\n<li>Face mask with ear loops: Hold the mask by the ear loops. Place a loop around each ear.</li>\n<li>Face mask with ties: Bring the mask to nose level, place the ties over the crown of your head, and secure with a bow.</li>\n<li>Face mask with bands: Hold the mask with your hand in the nosepiece or top of the masks at fingertips, allowing the headbands to hang freely below hands. Bring the mask to nose level and pull the top strap over your head so that it rests over the crown of your head. Pull the bottom strap over your head so that it rests at the nape of your neck.</li>\n</ul>\n<li>Ensure that the top of the mask is covering your nose.</li>\n<li>Pull the bottom of the mask over your mouth and chin.</li>\n<li>Complete hand hygiene again, after placing your mask on your face.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><span class=\"h2\">Doffing (Taking off):</span></p>\n<ol>\n<li>Once again, wash your hands before touching your face mask.</li>\n<li>Only touch the ear loops/ties/band. Do not touch your eyes, nose or mouth. Follow the instructions below for the type of mask you are using.</li>\n<ul>\n<li>Face mask with ear loops: Hold both of the ear loops and gently lift and remove the mask.</li>\n<li>Face mask with ties: Untie the bottom bow first then untie the top bow and pull the mask away from you as the ties are loosened.</li>\n<li>Face mask with bands: Lift the bottom strap over your head then pull the top strap over your head.</li>\n</ul>\n<li>Inspect the mask. If there are no holes or tears, you can continue to use the mask when needed.</li>\n<li>Launder your mask after every use in warm water with regular detergent.</li>\n<li>Finally, wash your hands after removing the mask.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><span class=\"h2\">Masking Tips and Reminders:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li>The mask should cover your mouth, nose, and chin.</li>\n<li>The mask should not be pulled down and worn under your chin (exposing your nose and mouth). You are placing yourself and others at high risk for contamination if your mask is not worn correctly!</li>\n<li>Avoid touching the front of the mask.</li>\n<li>Masks are effective only when used in combination with proper hand hygiene.</li>\n<li>Do not wear the mask if you identify a hole or tear.</li>\n<li>Wearing a mask does not take the place of social distancing or proper hand hygiene. Remain at least six feet apart and complete hand hygiene frequently.</li>\n<li>Hold each other accountable! Speak up if you see someone wearing their mask incorrectly.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong><a href=\"/covid-19/\" title=\"Paramount COVID 19\">Learn more about COVID-19 <i class=\"fas fa-arrow-circle-right\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i></a></strong></p><p></p>\n\t\t\t\t\t"
