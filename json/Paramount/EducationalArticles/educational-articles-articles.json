It’s what I’ve been doing for more than 20 years as a family medicine doctor at ProMedica Physicians Family Medicine. And now, I’m also the chief medical officer for Paramount Health Care. This means the family I care for has grown. So, I have an even bigger appreciation for the importance of the patient, physician and health plan working together to create the best possible outcomes. I truly believe Paramount is an advocate for every single one of its patients. Its benefits are proof. Here are six of my favorites:</p>\n<h3>1. Medication Therapy Management Program</h3>\n<p>This program helps those who qualify get the greatest health benefits from their medications by preventing or reducing drug-related risks and supporting good habits. It includes a comprehensive medication review via a one-on-one phone call with a pharmacist. It also includes a targeted medication review, in which Paramount Elite (HMO/PPO) connects with me as the patient’s doctor to recommend drugs that may be safer or work better than what my patient is currently taking.</p>\n<h3>2. Wellness Incentive</h3>\n<p>When you complete your annual wellness visit and two preventive health services, you’ll receive a $50 on a benefits card. I especially love this perk for my Paramount Elite Medicare patients, because some patients underestimate the importance of preventive screenings like mammograms and colorectal screenings. Maybe they think it won’t happen to them, or they’re busy, but early detection is so valuable.</p>\n<h3>3. Ask a Nurse</h3>\n<p>Ask a Nurse is available to members from 6 a.m. – midnight, 7-days-a-week. Our nurse line is staffed with a team of experienced registered nurses (RNs). They can answer health-related questions such as, “Should I see my doctor or go to an urgent care or emergency room?” It’s a nice addition to being able to call your doctor’s office.</p>\n<div>\n<div>\n<h3>4. Vision Benefits</h3>\n<p>As part of Paramount Elite benefits, members have coverage for some vision services that Medicare alone doesn’t cover. Our plan also covers glasses or contact lenses every 24 months.</p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<h3>5. Dental Benefits</h3>\n<p>As we age, scheduling regular visits with our dentist is more important than ever. Medications and common chronic illnesses, such as diabetes and heart disease, put seniors at an increased risk for dental problems. All Paramount Elite Medicare plans include preventive and comprehensive services at no cost to the member.</p>\n<p>Depending on your Paramount Elite Medicare plan, members have the option to purchase additional coverage for a low monthly premium for extras like coverage for crowns and fillings. You can search for all Paramount dental providers by using our online provider search tool <a href=\"https://www.insuringsmiles.com/FindADentist\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"pro-jump-link\">here</a>.</p>\n<p><a class=\"btn btn-primary btn-lg pro-jump-link\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.insuringsmiles.com/FindADentist\">Find a Dentist <i class=\"fas fa-external-link-alt\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i></a></p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<h3>6. SilverSneakers®</h3>\n<p>SilverSneakers is a fitness program that gives you a free basic gym membership to more than 15,000 fitness locations across the country. My patients enjoy amenities such as exercise equipment, pools and saunas, as well as fitness classes and other activities. There are six signature classes, available in select location, are geared toward varying fitness levels and interests. SilverSneakers FLEX® classes offer additional options, and for more challenging classes, try SilverSneakers BOOM™ Staying active as you age and working out with friends are good for the mind and body.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>If you’re looking for a Medicare plan that will go to great lengths to help keep you healthy, Paramount Elite may be right for you. If you’re already a member, I encourage you to take advantage of all it has to offer.</p>\n<p>Before selecting your Medicare plan, be sure to check out our complete <a href=\"/medicare/2023/new-to-medicare/medicare-checklist\">checklist</a>, which can help you pick the right plan.</p>\n<p><a href=\"/medicare/2023/new-to-medicare/medicare-checklist\">Use our easy checklist</a></p>\n<p><strong>Still have questions?</strong></p>\n<p>Give us a call.

That’s why we offer SilverSneakers® as your fitness benefit. With SilverSneakers, you can get active and stay healthy in the ways that work best for you. You can take live virtual classes at home, view workout videos, exercise with smaller groups in your area or go to the gym<sup>1</sup>. It’s all included at <strong>no additional cost</strong> to you.</p>\n<p>SilverSneakers also gives you valuable health and wellness information, like the following tips on setting and reaching goals.</p>\n<p>Here are <strong>three simple steps</strong> to start and keep going with a healthy activity habit.<sup>2</sup></p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Change the way you set goals.</strong> Specifically, start with smaller goals. Does 150 minutes of activity a week sound like a lot? It’s only 30 minutes a day for 5 weekdays – or however you choose to split it up.</li>\n<li><strong>Find an activity you truly enjoy.</strong> You’re far more likely to stick with exercising if you’re doing something you like.</li>\n<li><strong>Hold yourself accountable or find someone else who will.</strong> Work out with a friend. It’s more fun, and you won’t want to let your workout buddy down. Attending SilverSneakers fitness classes is also a great option.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Be sure your goals are <strong>SMART</strong>: <strong>S</strong>pecific, <strong>M</strong>easurable, <strong>A</strong>ttainable, <strong>R</strong>elevant and <strong>T</strong>ime-bound.<sup>3</sup></p>\n<ul>\n<ul>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Specific and Measurable.</strong> Know exactly what you will do and how you will check your success along the way. “Get in shape” is not specific enough. Instead, you might say, “Walk 20 to 30 minutes a day.” This is specific and easy to measure – you either did it or not.</li>\n<li><strong>Attainable.</strong> Be realistic and don’t set the goal too high. For example, rather than saying you’re giving up soda, say “I’ll drink a glass of water with each meal.” Then each time you do that, you’ll feel closer to your goal of giving up soda.</li>\n<li><strong>Relevant.</strong> Make sure it’s important to you. Why do you want to reach this goal? List the positive things that might happen once you reach the goal. Use those positive outcomes as your motivation.</li>\n<li><strong>Time-bound.</strong> Simply give yourself a deadline. And think in smaller, timely goals. If you want to run a 10k this year, start by saying you’ll run a mile in January. Then aim for two miles in February and continue adding monthly.</li>\n</ul>\n</ul>\n</ul>\n<p>Get a jump on reaching your goals this year with SilverSneakers.

You can only go so long without seeing family, friends, and loved ones, and for those discovering they have hearing loss, holiday travel has a different set of challenges. From road noise to communication issues—there’s a lot to navigate.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Follow these tips to make your holiday trips a little merrier.</p>\n<h2>General Travel</h2>\n<p>When travelling, do you often find yourself asking others to repeat themselves? The fewer questions you need to ask someone wearing a mask behind a plexiglass wall in a noisy lobby, the better.</p>\n<p>Get in the habit of using smartphone apps to manage reservations, navigation, and travel alerts. It also doesn’t hurt to keep some things old school. Bring back-up printed copies of important documents like hotel reservations and tickets.</p>\n<h2>Planes &amp; Trains</h2>\n<p>Have you noticed you’re missing out on important travel announcements? Let the conductor or flight attendant know you’re having difficulty hearing so they can make sure you’re informed of last-second changes. Know your schedules, sign up for text alerts through your airline or train’s app, and watch the live timetable screens for last-minute changes. Sit near the gate or departure lobby so you don’t miss boarding.</p>\n<h2>Automobiles</h2>\n<p>One of the worst parts of car rides for people with hearing loss is background noise. It’s even worse when roads are wet and slushy. If you’re taking a ride share, carry a notepad and pen to answer questions—or communicate with your driver by text using your phone’s rideshare app. It’s a good idea to politely notify your driver that you have hearing loss, so they don’t try to start up a conversation or think you’re being rude.</p>\n<h2>For Those Travelling with Hearing Aids</h2>\n<p>Always pack your hearing aid supplies—including extra batteries and charging cables—in a self-contained bag inside your carry-on, where it’s easy to access. You want to be prepared for unexpected delays or lost luggage. When walking through metal detectors and security checkpoints, you might feel the urge to remove your devices, but you don’t have to. Detection equipment is perfectly safe for the electronics in your hearing aids.</p>\n<h3>New tech could ease your travel woes.</h3>\n<p>If you’ve been thinking about getting your hearing checked, new advancements in hearing aid technology can make all the difference during holiday travel.&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Advanced noise reduction cuts airplane engine roar, chatter, and road rumble&nbsp;</li>\n<li>Some models offer directional microphone control and even Bluetooth® audio synching to get navigation instructions from your car or phone sent directly to your hearing aids</li>\n<li>Downloadable apps let you quickly and discreetly change hearing aid programs on the go</li>\n<li>Directional programming lets you focus on the person in front of you, a travel partner next to you, or fast-moving traffic coming from behind you</li>\n<li>Models with mask mode let you boost volumes when you can’t read lips&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Remember, as a Paramount Elite (HMO/PPO) member, you have access to hearing care through TruHearing®. With your benefit, you get up to two new hearing aids per year at a low copay of $999 or less per aid.</p>\n<p>If you’re experiencing hearing difficulty this holiday season, we hope you’ll take advantage of the program. Call TruHearing at <a href=\"tel:1-800-334-1807\" class=\"pro-jump-link\">800-334-1807</a> to schedule a hearing exam with a provider in your area.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Y0140_2021HearingAidNov_C</p><p></p>\n\t\t\t\t\t"

It’s never too late to replace old, unhealthy habits with new ones so you can feel better and do more of the things you love to do. May is National Senior Health and Fitness Month, making it the perfect time to commit to taking care of yourself – mind, body and spirit.</p>\n<h3>3 ways you can improve your quality of life, starting today:</h3>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Make healthy choices at every meal.</strong> A nutrient-rich diet can increase your energy, improve cognitive function, help manage weight, and reduce your risk for certain diseases.<sup>1,2</sup> And remember to stay hydrated by drinking water throughout the day.</li>\n<li><strong>Get moving.</strong> The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend that seniors get at least 150 minutes of moderate aerobic activity a week – about 30 minutes a day, five days a week. A brisk walk, exercise class or bike ride are great options. Even 10 minutes of exercise can deliver health benefits!<sup> 3</sup></li>\n<li><strong>Stay connected.</strong> Engaging with other people is important to our physical and mental health.<sup>4</sup> Sometimes social opportunities slow down as we age, but it’s important to find ways to connect with others in ways that are enjoyable to you.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Ready to get on board, but not sure where to start?

Beyond typical holiday parties, the hard of hearing have to navigate socially distant group gatherings, unreliable video call quality and audio, and mask wearing, which inhibits lip reading.</p>\n<p>Here are a few simple ways we can be more empathetic of those with hearing loss:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<h3>Speak naturally</h3>\n<p>When we know the person we’re talking to has hearing loss, it’s our instinct to “speak up” so that they can hear us better. But shouting only makes it more difficult for the person to understand us. Instead, speak clearly and naturally. Minimize background noise, keep hands away from your face, and make eye contact while talking so they can read your body language. And above all, be patient. If you can see that they’re struggling to understand you, try expressing your thoughts in a different way. They want to understand you as much as you want to understand them.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h3>Face masks</h3>\n<p>Many of us are covering our mouths with masks per the CDC recommendations to limit the spread of COVID-19. But face coverings make it harder for people with hearing loss who use lip reading to help them communicate with those around them. What can we do to help those with hearing loss—loved ones or strangers—feel included?</p>\n<p>It’s important to understand that we all read lips, whether we’re hearing impaired or not. It’s part of reading others’ body language. And masks can muffle sound and make it hard for people even without hearing loss to hear each other.</p>\n<p>The simplest solution is wearing a clear mask that allows others to see our lips while still providing the necessary coverage.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h3>Video calls</h3>\n<p>During the last year, video technology has become a major form of communication in the workplace, between family and friends, and in healthcare. And during this holiday season, video calls may be the only way we can celebrate with loved ones. Here are a few key tips to make video accessible for those with hearing loss:</p>\n</li>\n<ul>\n<li>When beginning the call, check with the other person to make sure they can hear and see you clearly. Sit near enough so they can see your face and keep your hands away from your lips so they can read them as you’re talking. Make eye contact and speak towards the microphone so they can consistently hear you.</li>\n<li>Because video calls are remote by default, masks aren’t needed. This makes lip reading much easier for the person with hearing loss.</li>\n</ul>\n</ul>\n<p>Spending time with family is an important part of every holiday season and this year will feel very different because of COVID-19. Make sure you and your family are taking care of your hearing health so you can have the best interactions possible.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Y0140_2021TruHearingDec_M Accepted</p><p></p>\n\t\t\t\t\t"

We know it’s an odd term to use to explain Medicare coverage. But it’s commonly used to describe the coverage gap that’s part of all Medicare Part D plans. It occurs when the health plan (Paramount) and member (you) have spent a certain amount of money on prescription drugs.</p>\n<p>We asked Paramount Elite Medicare pharmacist Craig Bogner, PharmD, BCPS, frequently asked questions to help you better understand the Medicare Part D donut hole.</p>\n<div class=\"panel-group\" id=\"accordion\" role=\"tablist\" aria-multiselectable=\"true\"><!---- what is the donut hole ------------->\n<div class=\"panel panel-default\">\n<div class=\"panel-heading\" role=\"tab\" id=\"headingOne\">\n<h4 class=\"panel-title\"><a class=\"collapsed\" role=\"button\" data-toggle=\"collapse\" data-parent=\"#accordion\" href=\"#collapseOne\" aria-expanded=\"true\" aria-controls=\"collapseOne\">WHAT IS THE DONUT HOLE? </a></h4>\n</div>\n<div id=\"collapseOne\" class=\"panel-collapse collapse in\" role=\"tabpanel\" aria-labelledby=\"headingOne\">\n<div class=\"panel-body\">\n<p>Medicare commonly refers to the donut hole by another name – coverage gap. When you read through your Evidence of Coverage (EOC) or monthly Medicare Part D Explanation of Benefits (EOB) report, this is the term commonly used. Coverage gap is the drug payment stage that begins when the total amount of your year-to-date total drug costs reaches $4,020.</p>\n<p>While most people do not reach this stage, for those who do, you will notice that your share of your drug’s costs often changes. A great way to keep track of how close you are to the coverage gap is to read the Explanation of Benefits (EOB) that we send monthly. It’s also called Your Monthly Prescription Drug Summary.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<!---- how does it work ------------->\n<div class=\"panel panel-default\">\n<div class=\"panel-heading\" role=\"tab\" id=\"headingTwo\">\n<h4 class=\"panel-title\"><a class=\"collapsed\" role=\"button\" data-toggle=\"collapse\" data-parent=\"#accordion\" href=\"#collapseTwo\" aria-expanded=\"false\" aria-controls=\"collapseTwo\">HOW DOES THE DONUT HOLE WORK? </a></h4>\n</div>\n<div id=\"collapseTwo\" class=\"panel-collapse collapse\" role=\"tabpanel\" aria-labelledby=\"headingTwo\">\n<div class=\"panel-body\">\n<p>The standard Medicare Part D plan includes four drug payment stages. This is very important because how much you pay for a covered Medicare Part D prescription depends on which payment stage you are in when you fill it. Whether you move from one payment stage to the next depends on how much is spent on your drugs. The four drug payment stages are:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Yearly deductible (when your coverage begins)</li>\n<li>Initial coverage</li>\n<li>Coverage gap or donut hole</li>\n<li>Catastrophic coverage</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Paramount designs benefits with the goal to improve your health and well-being while trying to control the costs our Medicare members incur. For example, none of our individual Medicare Part D plans have a deductible. You begin in the initial coverage stage when you fill your first prescription of the year.</p>\n<p>Most Medicare Part D plans have a coverage gap and some plans offer additional coverage for the coverage gap stage.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<!---- HOW MUCH DO I PAY DURING THE COVERAGE GAP?  ------------->\n<div class=\"panel panel-default\">\n<div class=\"panel-heading\" role=\"tab\" id=\"headingThree\">\n<h4 class=\"panel-title\"><a class=\"collapsed\" role=\"button\" data-toggle=\"collapse\" data-parent=\"#accordion\" href=\"#collapseThree\" aria-expanded=\"false\" aria-controls=\"collapseThree\">HOW MUCH DO I PAY DURING THE COVERAGE GAP? </a></h4>\n</div>\n<div id=\"collapseThree\" class=\"panel-collapse collapse\" role=\"tabpanel\" aria-labelledby=\"headingThree\">\n<div class=\"panel-body\">\n<p>When you fill prescriptions, we keep track of your total drug costs. Total drug costs is the total of all payments made for your covered Medicare Part D drugs. It includes what your plan pays, what you pay, and what others (programs or organizations) pay for your drugs. When this amount reaches $4,020, you enter the coverage gap stage or the donut hole. Again, reading your monthly EOB is a great way to keep track of how close you are to the coverage gap.</p>\n<p>Once in the donut hole, members pay no more than 25% of the negotiated price and a portion of the dispensing fee for brand name drugs. For generic drugs, you pay 25% of the price with the exception of Tier 1 – Preferred Generics. These medications will continue as $0 during the coverage gap.</p>\n<p>This is a great benefit because Tier 1 – Preferred Generics are commonly prescribed medications used to treat many of the health conditions affecting our members like diabetes, high blood pressure and high blood cholesterol.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<!---- CAN YOU GIVE AN EXAMPLE OF HOW THE DONUT HOLE WORKS?  ------------->\n<div class=\"panel panel-default\">\n<div class=\"panel-heading\" role=\"tab\" id=\"headingFour\">\n<h4 class=\"panel-title\"><a class=\"collapsed\" role=\"button\" data-toggle=\"collapse\" data-parent=\"#accordion\" href=\"#collapseFour\" aria-expanded=\"false\" aria-controls=\"collapseFour\">CAN YOU GIVE AN EXAMPLE OF HOW THE DONUT HOLE WORKS? </a></h4>\n</div>\n<div id=\"collapseFour\" class=\"panel-collapse collapse\" role=\"tabpanel\" aria-labelledby=\"headingFour\">\n<div class=\"panel-body\">\n<p>On the Medicare.gov website, there is a good summary of how the coverage gap works, including two helpful examples of how to calculate how much you pay – one for brand drugs and one for generics.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<!---- DOES EVERYONE ENTER THE DONUT HOLE?  ------------->\n<div class=\"panel panel-default\">\n<div class=\"panel-heading\" role=\"tab\" id=\"headingFive\">\n<h4 class=\"panel-title\"><a class=\"collapsed\" role=\"button\" data-toggle=\"collapse\" data-parent=\"#accordion\" href=\"#collapseFive\" aria-expanded=\"false\" aria-controls=\"collapseFive\">DOES EVERYONE ENTER THE DONUT HOLE? </a></h4>\n</div>\n<div id=\"collapseFive\" class=\"panel-collapse collapse\" role=\"tabpanel\" aria-labelledby=\"headingFive\">\n<div class=\"panel-body\">\n<p>No. While many people enter the coverage gap stage, most do not. It’s very important to monitor the monthly EOB we send you. This will help you understand when you might enter into the coverage gap and what you will pay once you’re in the donut hole.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<!---- WHEN DO YOU GET OUT OF THE DONUT HOLE? ------------->\n<div class=\"panel panel-default\">\n<div class=\"panel-heading\" role=\"tab\" id=\"headingSix\">\n<h4 class=\"panel-title\"><a class=\"collapsed\" role=\"button\" data-toggle=\"collapse\" data-parent=\"#accordion\" href=\"#collapseSix\" aria-expanded=\"false\" aria-controls=\"collapseSix\">WHEN DO YOU GET OUT OF THE DONUT HOLE? </a></h4>\n</div>\n<div id=\"collapseSix\" class=\"panel-collapse collapse\" role=\"tabpanel\" aria-labelledby=\"headingSix\">\n<div class=\"panel-body\">\n<p>You generally stay in this stage until the amount of your year-to-date out-of-pocket costs reaches $6,350. Keep track of how close you are to leaving the coverage gap stage by reviewing the EOB that we send you monthly.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<!---- WHAT SHOULD I KNOW ABOUT PARAMOUNT&#8217;S MEDICARE PLAN WHEN IT COMES TO THE DONUT HOLE? ------------->\n<div class=\"panel panel-default\">\n<div class=\"panel-heading\" role=\"tab\" id=\"headingSeven\">\n<h4 class=\"panel-title\"><a class=\"collapsed\" role=\"button\" data-toggle=\"collapse\" data-parent=\"#accordion\" href=\"#collapseSeven\" aria-expanded=\"false\" aria-controls=\"collapseSeven\">WHAT SHOULD I KNOW ABOUT PARAMOUNT’S MEDICARE PLAN WHEN IT COMES TO THE DONUT HOLE? </a></h4>\n</div>\n<div id=\"collapseSeven\" class=\"panel-collapse collapse\" role=\"tabpanel\" aria-labelledby=\"headingSeven\">\n<div class=\"panel-body\">\n<p>If you reach the coverage gap, Tier 1 – Preferred Generics will continue to generate a $0 copay.

In fact, John Meier, MD, senior medical director at Paramount Health Care and board-certified in family medicine, encourages those just entering Medicare or shopping for a new plan to consider more than just cost. \"It’s important for everyone, especially baby boomers who consider themselves healthy, to research more than just how much a plan costs. You have to look at things like the quality of the providers, member satisfaction and the plan’s customer service.\"</p>\n<h2>Fortunately, Medicare star ratings can help with all of that.</h2>\n<p>If you’ve narrowed down your plans to a few with similar cost and coverage (that is, you know the plans include your doctors, offer your prescriptions and cover you when you’re out of state), then star ratings can be an extremely helpful way to home in on the plan that’s best for you.</p>\n<h4>What makes them so enlightening?</h4>\n<p>First, star ratings let you see how current members rate the plans you’re considering. Second, they shed light on how each plan performed in various areas. Finally, they can help you choose a highly rated plan, since all plans are evaluated on the exact same criteria.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2>How many stars can a Medicare plan receive?</h2>\n<p>All plans are rated on a scale from 1 to 5, 1 being poor and 5 being excellent.</p>\n<h4><span style=\"color: #ffcc00;\"><i class=\"fas fa-star\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i><i class=\"fas fa-star\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i><i class=\"fas fa-star\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i><i class=\"fas fa-star\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i><i class=\"fas fa-star\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i></span> Excellent</h4>\n<h4><span style=\"color: #ffcc00;\"><i class=\"fas fa-star\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i><i class=\"fas fa-star\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i><i class=\"fas fa-star\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i><i class=\"fas fa-star\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i></span> Above Average</h4>\n<h4><span style=\"color: #ffcc00;\"><i class=\"fas fa-star\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i><i class=\"fas fa-star\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i><i class=\"fas fa-star\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i></span> Average</h4>\n<h4><span style=\"color: #ffcc00;\"><i class=\"fas fa-star\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i><i class=\"fas fa-star\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i></span> Below Average</h4>\n<h4><span style=\"color: #ffcc00;\"><i class=\"fas fa-star\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i></span> Poor</h4>\n<hr>\n<h3>How are Medicare Advantage plans rated?</h3>\n<ol>\n<li><em>Staying healthy</em><br> This includes things like screening tests, vaccines, flu shots, checkups and reported improvements in physical health over a two-year period.</li>\n<li><em>Managing chronic conditions</em><br> This looks at how often members with certain chronic conditions, like diabetes or high blood pressure, received tests and recommended treatments to help them manage their long-term condition.</li>\n<li><em>Member experience with the health plan</em><br> This is how members rated their overall satisfaction with the plan.</li>\n<li><em>Member complaints and changes in the health plan’s performance</em><br> This looks at how often members had problems with the plan and/or chose to leave the plan, and if and how much the plan improved.</li>\n<li><em>Health plan customer service</em><br> Personalized and responsive service is important to many Medicare members, and this rating addresses how well member services handles member calls, questions and requests.</li>\n</ol>\n<h4>How are Part D (prescription) plans rated?</h4>\n<ol>\n<li><em>Drug plan customer service</em><br> This rating addresses how well member services handles member calls, questions and requests.</li>\n<li><em>Member complaints and changes in the drug plan’s performance</em><br> This looks at how often members had problems with the plan and/or chose to leave the plan, and if and how much the plan improved.</li>\n<li><em>Member experience with the drug plan</em><br> This is how members rated their overall satisfaction with the plan.</li>\n<li><em>Drug safety and accuracy of drug pricing</em><br> This category is reflective of how accurate the plan’s pricing is and how often members with medical conditions are prescribed drugs in a way that is safer and clinically recommended for their specific condition.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Plans that cover both health and drug services (Medicare Advantage plans with prescription drug coverage) receive an overall rating for quality and performance that includes all of these criteria.</p>\n<p class=\"lead\">Need a Medicare plan that’s right for you?</p>\n<p>Paramount Elite Medicare offers a variety of Medicare Advantage plans and we’re happy to help you find one that fits your health needs, lifestyle and budget.

You may be familiar with Original Medicare, which includes Medicare Part A (hospital coverage) and Part B (medical coverage). But, there's an option that goes beyond what Original Medicare has to offer – a Medicare Advantage plan.</p>\n<p><button type=\"button\" class=\"btn btn-default btn-lg\">Learn more about Paramount Elite Medicare Advantage plans </button></p>\n<h3>What is a Medicare Advantage plan?</h3>\n<p>A Medicare Advantage plan, also known as Medicare Part C or an MA plan, takes the place of your Original Medicare coverage. It also provides additional benefits not included by Original Medicare, offering more comprehensive healthcare coverage for you. If you're enrolled in Medicare Part A and Part B, you're qualified to enroll in a Medicare Advantage plan.*</p>\n<h3>Benefits of a Medicare Advantage plan</h3>\n<hr>\n<p>So, how do Medicare Advantage plans work? They are offered by private insurance companies that are approved by Medicare. Once you join the plan, you pay the private insurance company directly, and they work with Medicare to ensure your healthcare coverage is handled. While healthcare benefits vary from plan to plan, Medicare Advantage plans provide a variety of key overall benefits:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Benefits coverage:</strong> A Medicare Advantage plan covers all the benefits of Medicare Part A and Part B, plus many also include prescription drug, dental, hearing and vision benefits, as well as fitness programs like SilverSneakers®. A Medicare Advantage plan allows for more comprehensive healthcare coverage, in addition to keeping you protected in case of unexpected illness or injury.</li>\n<li><strong>Convenience:</strong> A Medicare Advantage plan allows you to choose your benefits through a private insurance provider, giving you the convenience of a single plan and a \"one-stop-shop\" for all your medical and prescription drug coverage. Maximum out-of-pocket: Each plan offers a maximum out-of-pocket on how much you will spend on health expenses, and once the limit is reached, your medical costs will be covered in full. This is a benefit to those who know they will have a high number of medical expenses they'll need to handle.</li>\n<li><strong>Emergency Care/Urgent Care:</strong> Medicare Advantage plans must offer emergency and urgent care coverage outside the plan's service area throughout the United States, meaning you'll be covered nationwide.</li>\n<li><strong>Familiarity:</strong> If you've been on an employer health insurance plan, a Medicare Advantage plan works in a comparable way. You'll have the comfort of better understanding your health insurance plan because it works like employer-provided (commercial) health insurance. You'll still see deductibles, coinsurance, physician networks and other elements you're used to with health insurance.</li>\n</ol>\n<hr>\n<h3>Discover hassle-free Medicare with Paramount Elite</h3>\n<p>Because Paramount Elite (HMO/PPO) is a Medicare-approved health maintenance organization (HMO), we can offer a variety of Medicare Advantage plans as flexible healthcare options.
